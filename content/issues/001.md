Hi!
A few weeks ago, a friend of mine (üëã Wouter) asked why I don‚Äôt collect the links and articles I tweet out in a newsletter.
This seemed like a great idea to push myself to write a bit more, and I really like the idea of having an archive of stuff I‚Äôve read and enjoyed that‚Äôs a bit more organized than my Pocket archive.

So here goes!

I‚Äôll be adding links about anything I‚Äôve found interesting, usually about tech, machine learning and media.
My (first) goal is to send out this newsletter **every two weeks** on **Sunday** for **ten issues**.
Let‚Äôs jump in.

**Machine Learning üì±**

Cade Metz at The New York Times published a great article about state of the art natural language processing: [Finally, a Machine That Can Finish Your Sentence](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/technology/artificial-intelligence-language.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web)

Katherine Bailey wrote a blog post about the future of work in an AI world.
I really like how she differentiates ‚Äúthe task‚Äù (e.g.
identifying tumors in MRI scans) from ‚Äúthe job‚Äù (e.g.
being a radiologist who interprets results and communicates them).
Read it here: [AI and the Future of Work](https://katbailey.github.io/post/ai-and-the-future-of-work/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web)

Janelle Shane‚Äôs thread on machine learning systems completing a task in funny, unintended ways is hilarious:

* [Shane‚Äôs thread](https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane/status/1060563586789982208?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Twitter)
* [An even longer list of examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Google Docs)

**Media üóû**

After [Blendle](http://blendle.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (the pay-per-article ‚Äúpremium journalism‚Äù aggregator) went international, another Dutch news media company, De Correspondent, is now launching beyond the Netherlands.
The Correspondent‚Äôs aim is to ‚Äú#unbreaknews‚Äù through 100% ad-free paid journalism.

* Founder Rob Wijnberg: [What fast food is to the body, news is to the mind. Time to break that habit](https://medium.com/de-correspondent/what-fast-food-is-to-the-body-news-is-to-the-mind-time-to-break-that-habit-cac66fb5b2ba?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Medium)

The New York Times published a big story about how executives handled the Russian social media manipulation crisis in the last two years.
It‚Äôs not pretty.

WikiTribune (Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales‚Äô project for community-driven news) has run out of funding and laid off its journalist staff; it‚Äôs going to focus on community-generated content now.
I‚Äôve contributed (a tiny bit) to WikiTribune before and I like the idea of the project a lot.
But I‚Äôm not super optimistic that it‚Äôll be around a year from now.

**Tech** üì±

Benedict Evans‚Äô presentation on the current state and next wave of tech.
Must watch, as always: [The end of the beginning](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/11/16/the-end-of-the-beginning?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web / YouTube)

Lots of people in the Apple podcast sphere have been talking about iPad as a productivity platform.
iOS has a few obvious flaws on the iPad.
The big one right now is that you can plug in a USB-C drive but only see the pictures and videos on it; in spite of iOS‚Äôs new Files app, you can‚Äôt take files off a drive.
But for people who can get around these flaws, like Frederico Viticci, the platform looks pretty incredible:[ My Markdown Writing and Collaboration Workflow, Powered by Working Copy 3.6, iCloud Drive, and GitHub](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web)

I identify with a lot in this post about Facebook‚Äôs path toward irrelevance.
I never post to my feed anymore; all I use is groups (mostly to get my rowing work out schedules) and events (event discovery is where Facebook definitely rules for me).

**Other Things ‚ú®**

‚ÄúIf you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived.‚Äù Great blog post by John Salvatier about the hidden complexity of pretty much everything and why we get stuck on problems: [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web)

In your head, is South America mostly east of Florida?
Is two-thirds of Africa in the northern hemisphere?

**My Stuff üòÅ**

I published one of my Machine Learning Practical courseworks, on exploring different neural net training techniques for handwritten digit recognition on EMNIST.
I‚Äôm pretty proud of how it turned out:

Alright, that‚Äôs it for the first issue!
Let me know what you liked and didn‚Äôt like via WhatsApp or Messenger :)

PS: The name, Dynamically Typed, comes from [my Medium blog ](https://dynamicallytyped.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)that I don‚Äôt use nearly enough.
I‚Äôll see if it sticks or if I think of something else.
