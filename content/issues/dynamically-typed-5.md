# #5: Hey Google, what's a Golden Kitty? 

Hi and welcome to issue #5 of Dynamically Typed!
There are 25 of you now, a number that has been approximately doubling for every issue I‚Äôve sent out ‚Äì so, by a bit over a year from now, if this trend continues, every person in the world should be subscribed.
But how am I ever [going to afford that many grains of wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)?

This issue covers Uber‚Äôs myriad use cases for ML, the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show, Golden Kitties for AI products, and much more.
Let‚Äôs dive in.

## Productized Artificial Intelligence üîå

**ProductHunt announced the Golden Kitty awards,** which this year included an AI & Machine Learning Product of the Year category.
The winner is [OneSoil Map](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/onesoil-map-2?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (ProductHunt), [an interactive map](https://map.onesoil.ai/2018?about&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#3.6/50.49/4.96) (Web) that detects 60 million fields across the US and Europe and classifies them by one of 20 crop types, all from satellite images.
It‚Äôs super cool to scroll around ‚Äì make sure you zoom in!

**Jeremy Hermann and Mike Del Balso posted a deep dive on how ML is used at Uber.**
Use cases include personalized Uber Eats rankings, driver/rider marketplace forecasting, customer support automation, crash detection using drivers‚Äô phones, ETAs, ‚Äúone-click‚Äù chat replies for drivers, and self-driving cars.
The post also covers how ML works on both organizational and technical levels at Uber: [Scaling Machine Learning at Uber with Michelangelo](https://eng.uber.com/scaling-michelangelo/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web)

**Google Assistant** **now has an _interpreter mode_** : ask any Google-powered smart speaker ‚ÄúHey, Google help me speak Dutch‚Äù (or any of the other 27 supported languages), and it‚Äôll translate everything you say.
Then, when the person you‚Äôre talking to replies, it‚Äôll translate what they say back to English (or to whichever language you were speaking to begin with).
It‚Äôs not perfect, but if I was, say, an Airbnb host who‚Äôs receiving foreign guests, I‚Äôd want this _yesterday_.
Shannon Liao at The Verge got a demo: [Google Assistant‚Äôs new interpreter mode can translate conversations ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not magic ](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18170806/google-assistant-translate-languages-real-time-interpreter-ces-2019?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)(Web)

**Marques Brownlee got to ride in a driverless taxi** at CES 2019.
This self-driving car by Yandex is another example of a system that‚Äôs close to being autonomous in a very restricted geographic area, like we‚Äôve seen before from Google, Waymo and Voyage.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the first real public deployment of a self-driving taxi fleet in (a small part of) a city sometime this year.

**Chris Hartland at Textio** (an ‚Äúaugmented writing‚Äù service that aims to improve all kinds of writing in businesses) wrote a blog post on how to think about machine learning for products.
The upshot: don‚Äôt build a product around your ML model ‚Äì build a great product that happens to be powered by ML.
The former is something we‚Äôve seen a lot of in recent years ( _cough NoSQL, cough blockchain_ ), so I think it‚Äôs a good take: [Machine Learning in Production ](https://hackernoon.com/machine-learning-in-production-ed65c58ffd1e?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)(Medium).

## Machine Learning Technology üéõ

**Jeff Dean has posted a look back at Google‚Äôs AI research in 2018** on the Google AI blog.
In a broad overview, it covers everything from Google‚Äôs open source datasets and AI ethics principles, to their papers on perception and computational photography.
It‚Äôs pretty crazy how many different areas Google‚Äôs research touched on last year: [Looking Back at Google‚Äôs Research Efforts in 2018](http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/01/looking-back-at-googles-research.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web)

**Microsoft has launched their Ability Initiative** with the University of Texas at Austin.
They‚Äôre aiming to improve automatic image captioning for blind and low-vision people.
See their announcement here: [Microsoft Ability Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-ability-initiative-a-collaborative-quest-to-innovate-in-image-captioning-for-people-who-are-blind-or-with-low-vision/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web).

**Lionel Gueguen et al.
at Uber Engineering** blogged about their paper speeding up convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that take JPEG images as input.
Their main insight is that (1) the bottom few layers of a typical CNN mostly transforms an image from pixels to a frequency representation and (2) the last steps of JPEG decompression do the exact opposite ‚Äì so you could strip these both out and feed JPEG‚Äôs internal frequency representation straight into the CNN!
Gueguen‚Äôs approach yields a slight accuracy improvement on the standard ImageNet classification task, but, amazingly, also a _1.8x speed improvement_.

## Tech and Startups üöÄ

![LG's rollable TV, showed off at CES, hides itself in its speaker bar when you're done using it (LG)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/004/124/935/mail/lg-rollable-tv-ces-2019_key-visual.jpg?1547986676)
_LG's rollable TV, showed off at CES, hides itself in its speaker bar when you're done using it (LG)_

**Earlier this month, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) happened.**
Lots of companies showed off their vision for the future, from the coming year‚Äôs television sets all the way to far-out visions for self-driving car interiors.
There‚Äôs always a lot of coverage of CES, and I‚Äôve collected the best of it right here so you don‚Äôt have to dig through the cynical hot takes yourself:

- As usual, Steven Sinofsky of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) wrote up an extensive show report. Lots of internet-connected home stuff, most of it now capable of talking to voice assistants, and lots of things that call themselves AI but aren‚Äôt. Read it here, and scroll about 80% down for the amazing ‚Äújust have to share‚Äù section:[ CES 2019: A Show Report ](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/ces-85ca9f07c08a?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)(Medium)
- Samuel Axon at Ars Technica has a a good run-down of products announced at CES that will actually come on the market in 2019. From laptops and TVs to smart clocks and VR, it‚Äôs mostly iterative improvements on already good products: [The best PCs, gadgets, and future tech of CES 2019](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/the-best-pcs-gadgets-and-future-tech-of-ces-2019/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Web)
- LG‚Äôs rollable TVs looks really cool. A lot of people don‚Äôt like the look of a big black screen in their living room, and this looks like a much better solution than those TVs that try to pretend a wall when they‚Äôre off. Check out Marques Brownlee‚Äôs video: [The Rollable OLED TV: The Potential is Real!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=D1pa3UX89GA) (YouTube)

**Benedict Evans at a16z wrote a post on the promise of 5G,** the successor standard to the 4G we currently have in our phones.
It‚Äôll mostly have lower latency for phones at long distances, and higher speed at short distances (to replace your internet cable).
A lot of the hype in the industry is around 5G-enabled virtual reality, augmented reality and self-driving cars, but out of those Evans thinks it‚Äôll only make a real difference for AR, and maybe for last-mile remote piloting of delivery trucks.
Network slicing is 5G‚Äôs most interesting feature:

> One of the cooler features of 5G is that it lets you split out dedicated capacity for particular use cases - so-called ‚Äònetwork slicing‚Äô.
> Today (to simplify hugely), although network operators try to do traffic management, all traffic in the cell is fundamentally using the same capacity.
> 5G lets you create dedicated private capacity in the radios network with specific characteristics.
> So, you could sell a truck operator dedicated capacity on the two miles between a specific freeway exit and a specific warehouse.
> Or, you could offer an IoT operator (or alarm company) much lower bandwidth but over a wider area.

**Amazon launched DocumentDB** , its MongoDB competitor.
While AWS adds new services pretty much every other week, this launch is interesting because it tells a bigger story about the state of open source software.
Basically, lots of VC-funded open source software companies supported itself by helping big companies install and run their software on their servers, consultancy-style.
But now that everything is moving to the cloud (and mostly Amazon‚Äôs cloud), and no one‚Äôs running their own servers anymore, where will these software companies make money?
And what does this mean for the open source ecosystem?

## Cool Things ‚ú®

_A screenshot about 2/3rds down Cameron's World (cameronsworld.net)_

**This isn‚Äôt exactly new, but I think it‚Äôs _amazing:_** at Cameron‚Äôs World, [Cameron Askin](https://twitter.com/cameronaskin/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (Twitter) is recreating beautiful, weird websites from the 90s that were created before everything got slurped up into algorithm-ordered news feeds.
This stuff was a little before my time online, but it‚Äôs a ton of fun to scroll through.

**Hossein Derakhshan, who went to jail for blogging in Iran,** wrote a blog post reflecting on the state of the internet today, where the power has shifted from people (hyper)linking to each others‚Äô blogs to big American companies siloing content into their ‚ÄúStreams.‚Äù Here‚Äôs an excerpt:

> Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object ‚Äî the same as a photo, or a piece of text ‚Äî instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer.
> You‚Äôre encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed.
> Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated, stripped of their powers.

The whole post is definitely worth a read, and it made me appreciate platforms (like this one!) where it‚Äôs just me and you controlling the conversation.
I choose when to send emails, and you choose whether and when to open them, with no content ranking algorithm in between.
If Revue, the platform I use to send these emails, shuts down or kicks me off, I can use another one and you likely won‚Äôt even notice the difference.
That‚Äôs very different from Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
It‚Äôs a bit ironic, then, that Derakhshan‚Äôs post is on Medium ‚Äì a platform that‚Äôs great for distributing content to ‚Äúthe Stream,‚Äù but that keeps a blogger‚Äôs audience and domain under its control.
