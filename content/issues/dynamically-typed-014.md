# #14: Artificial intelligence for medicine and the climate crisis 

Hey everyone, this is the 14th issues of Dynamically Typed.
Since there are also 14 days between each issue, that means I‚Äôve now been doing this newsletter for 14^2 = 196 days‚Äîover half a year!

Recently, I‚Äôve become more interested in how artificial intelligence can be used to fight [the climate crisis](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/climate-101?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), so I‚Äôm dedicating a section in today‚Äôs DT to a few projects I‚Äôve come across in this space.
Is this something you‚Äôd like to see in future editions as well?
Let me know by replying to this email.

Other news I‚Äôm covering today includes a lot of research by Google, from end-to-end systems for detecting lung cancer in CT scans and translating speech to speech, to a framework of best practices for applied AI.
Related, there‚Äôs new work from Stripe and the Wolfram Language centered around deploying machine learning systems at scale.

## Productized Artificial Intelligence üîå

**Google‚Äôs Devvret Rishi and Margaret Jennings wrote up a framework of best practices for applied AI** based on their work with ten fintech startups through Google‚Äôs [Launchpad accelerator](https://developers.google.com/programs/launchpad/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
The framework is divided into three sections:

1. _Framing the problem:_ getting the right team, incentives and expectations in place
2. _Building the model:_ starting simple and focusing on data pipelines over fancy models (‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a hero‚Äù)
3. _Deploying, measuring, monitoring:_ testing for performance and biases early and thoroughly

A lot of their main takeaways mirror [Josh Cogan‚Äôs earlier post for the Launchpad blog](https://medium.com/thelaunchpad/the-ml-surprise-f54706361a6c?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (see [DT #7](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/7-no-code-no-problem-from-indie-makers-to-machine-learning-158462?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)): building and tuning fancy machine learning models is not what takes the most time in productizing AI:

> We can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of starting simple, with a clear business goal tied to the model‚Äôs output

> Collecting data, cleaning data, augmenting your relatively small dataset, and aligning on a common business value will take the majority of your time

## Artificial Intelligence for the Climate Crisis üåç

_GAN-generated images of houses before and after a flood hits. (Schmidt et al.)_

**Victor Schmidt et al.
used Generative Adversarial Networks to visualize the consequences of climate change.**
Their GAN is trained on street-view images of houses before and after catastrophic extreme weather events like floods and forest fires, which the climate crisis will exacerbate.
The trained model takes an image of a house and, if it is located in a region that climate models predict will be hit by the effects of climate change in the next 50 years, transform it into what the house would look like when it is hit by extreme weather.
Schmidt et al.
hope that this will help create ‚Äúa more visceral understanding of the effects of climate change.‚Äù Read more about it here:

**Alina Tugend wrote about several artificial intelligence projects around climate change for The New York Times.**
They include:

* Dr. Maria Uriarte of Columbia University is [using AI to analyze how different types of trees are affected by hurricanes](https://uriartelab.org/forest-disturbance-and-regrowth/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). She trained a network to identify tree species in satellite images, allowing her to use before-and-after images to compare the rates at which different species survive a hurricane.
* Stanford‚Äôs [Grid Resilience & Intelligence Platform](https://gismo.slac.stanford.edu/projects/grip.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (GRIP) project uses satellite imagery to ‚Äúanticipate, absorb and recover from events that cause grid outages, such as extreme weather or a cyberattack.‚Äù
* The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is using machine learning to more efficiently genetically engineer wheat to resist worsening growing conditions caused by climate change.
* [One Concern](https://www.oneconcern.com/blog/2018-the-dawn-of-benevolent-intelligence-5LICUH70ty2cw0owEG2Os4/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) uses artificial intelligence to forecast damage due to earthquakes and flooding.

## Machine Learning Technology üéõ

![Google's lung cancer prediction model (Shravya Shetty, The Keyword)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/004/626/402/mail/3f06ea2cd6272a88cae1cbac92073736.png?1558780967)

_Google's lung cancer prediction model (Shravya Shetty, The Keyword)_

**Google AI‚Äôs Health division has published a new end-to-end lung cancer screening system.**
The model, published in Nature Medicine, takes a 3D CT scan as input and outputs a prediction of whether it is a potential cancer case; it does this very effectively:

> When using a single CT scan for diagnosis, our model performed on par or better than the six radiologists.
> We detected five percent more cancer cases while reducing false-positive exams by more than 11 percent compared to unassisted radiologists in our study.

It‚Äôs very cool to see advanced ML technology being published outside of the usual AI conferences: besides the obvious scientific and medical value of this specific contribution, hopefully publications like this will help scientists in other fields understand more deeply what types of problems AI is good at tackling.

**Also from Google: Translatotron, an end-to-end speech-to-speech translation model.**
Previous models for translating spoken text would take three steps: (1) automatic speech recognition to turn the spoken source sentence into text, (2) machine translation to turn translate into the target language, and (3) text-to-speech synthesis to ‚Äúspeak‚Äù it.
Translatotron does this all in one go, improving translation speed, reducing compounding errors between steps, and making it easier to retain the voice of the original speaker in the translation (which is really, really cool).

**Rob Story wrote about Railyard, an API and job manager that payments processor Stripe uses for scalable machine learning.**
Stripe uses machine learning for everything from fraud detection to retrying failed credit card charges, and it has teams training hundreds of new models every day.
Railyard streamlines this process by exposing an API to which data scientists can submit jobs from any ML framework.
Running on top of Stripe‚Äôs Kubernetes cluster, Railyard then trains, evaluates and saves the model.
This takes away the cognitive load of having to think about infrastructure, operations, model state, etc., so data scientists can focus just on building and testing their models.
Story‚Äôs full post explains how they implemented this at Stripe: [Railyard: how we rapidly train machine learning models with Kubernetes](https://stripe.com/gb/blog/railyard-training-models?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

**The Wolfram Engine is now free for developers to encourage its use in production systems;** this engine is what powers the Wolfram Language and [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
I‚Äôve always wanted to get more into the Wolfram Language because it has implementations of lots of machine learning models, plus an enormous set of built-in ‚Äúcomputational knowledge‚Äù about the real world:

> There are now altogether 5000+ functions in the language, covering everything from visualization to machine learning, numerics, image computation, geometry, higher math and natural language understanding‚Äîas well as lots of areas of real-world knowledge (geo, medical, cultural, engineering, scientific, etc.).

I never thought of a project that I could build end-to-end in the Wolfram Language ecosystem, but this release now makes it possible to run the Wolfram Engine on a server and call into it from other programming languages, opening up a world of possibilities.
