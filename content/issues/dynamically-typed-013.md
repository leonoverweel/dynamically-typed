# #13: Caption this: new AI-powered features at Google I/O, and OpenAI's staged GPT-2 release 

This week, Google had their yearly I/O developer conference.
They announced a slew of new AI-powered features for their services, from automatic subtitles for any video on an Android device to an menu-reading AR app that shows you photos of popular dishes at a restaurant.

OpenAI also responded to community concerns by open-sourcing a larger version of their GPT-2 language model, and Dropbox published a deep dive on the process of building a machine learning document recommendation feature into their app.

_(Small note: today‚Äôs issue is a bit shorter than usual because I‚Äôm in full-on exam crunch mode‚ÄîI had one last Wednesday, and two more coming up tomorrow and Tuesday.
Final pre-thesis stretch!)_

## Productized Artificial Intelligence üîå

**Google announced a slew of new features across their products at I/O, their yearly developer conference.**
Here are the ones that jumped out as productized AI to me:

* Google‚Äôs augmented reality (AR) camera app, Lens, will be able to understand a restaurant menu you point it at. It‚Äôll highlight popular dishes and show you photos of the dish that were taken at the restaurant. After the meal, it‚Äôll be able to split the bill for you as well.
* Duplex, the ‚Äúcall this restaurant and make a reservation for me‚Äù feature that Google demonstrated at I/O last year, will now also work on websites, automatically going through reservation flows to book things like rental cars and hotels.
* Google Search will use AR to place shopping search results into the real world. For example, it‚Äôll show you what a pair of shoes will look like on your feet.
* Android will get a new feature called Live Caption, which uses on-device speech recognition to add subtitles to any video. The feature will also come to phone calls.

All these announcements underline just how much Google is investing in machine learning, both on the research and product sides, and that AI is now a big part of pretty much every part of the company.

**Dropbox is using machine learning to predict what file you need next,** and software engineer [Neeraj Kumar](https://neerajkumar.org/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) wrote a great post about their journey building this feature for the Dropbox tech blog.
The team started with an initial heuristics-based baseline, which allowed them to design the surrounding infrastructure and front-end code, and to monitor users‚Äô response to the feature: does it actually help them get to the file they‚Äôre looking for faster?

With that baseline in place, they figured out what types of file-use patterns the heuristics-based method wasn‚Äôt picking up, and used that to design several iterations of a machine learning model.
Kumar‚Äôs post dives more into this, as well as some other interesting production issues they ran into, from figuring out what metrics to use to working out how to perform statistically significant experiments while the app‚Äôs UI changed.

**Microsoft is adding an AI-powered upgrade of its spell checker.**
The new feature is called Ideas and it‚Äôs available in the online version of Word.
It also does much more than tell you when you‚Äôve misspelled a word; it will:

* Help you rewrite complex sentences into more concise ones
* Point out non-inclusive language and suggest appropriate replacements
* Pick out key points of a text to generate a summary

## Machine Learning Technology üéõ

**OpenAI has open-sourced a larger version of their GPT-2 language model.**
They previously only released a 117 million parameter version, citing their concerns for abuse of the full-size model by malicious actors, a decision that much of the community disagreed with.
(See [DT #8](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/8-should-openai-open-source-their-impressive-new-language-model-161119?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for my take on that debate).
OpenAI has now changed course and released a larger version, GPT-2-345M, which is nearly three times larger than the original release.
Additionally, they‚Äôre giving select partners, like established university research labs, access to the even larger 762M and 1.5B parameter versions.
It‚Äôs good to see OpenAI responding to the community‚Äôs criticism like this, and I‚Äôm excited for the art projects and demo sites (such as the one I featured below) that this medium-sized model will spawn.

_What OpenAI's medium-size GPT-2 model thinks I'm up to this year. (Adam King)_

**Adam King launched Talk to Transformer, an interactive website for OpenAI‚Äôs medium-sized language model.**
Thanks to OpenAI‚Äôs open-source release of a larger version of GPT-2 and King‚Äôs engineering work building a site around it, anyone can now generate completions of short text prompts.
I tried it out above with a prompt of what I‚Äôm currently up to (bold text), and it generated a fairly realistic-sounding biography (regular text).
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be writing a PhD thesis during my MSc, though‚Ä¶

I encourage you to play around with Talk to Transformer and share your generated completions with friends: it‚Äôs a lot of fun and, more importantly, it spreads awareness of the capabilities of these AI models to a broader audience (see [DT #8](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/8-should-openai-open-source-their-impressive-new-language-model-161119?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
