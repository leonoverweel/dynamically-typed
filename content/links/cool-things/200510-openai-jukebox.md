[OpenAI Jukebox](https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is “a neural net that generates music, including rudimentary singing, as raw audio in a variety of genres and artist styles.” Come for the audio samples, stay for the t-SNE cluster of artists and genres the model learns without supervision.
In one fun application, the model is shown the first 12 seconds of a song and then tries to realistically generate the rest of the track—my favorite is [Jukebox’s continuation of Adele’s Rolling in the Deep](https://youtu.be/iJgNpm8cTE8?t=14&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
