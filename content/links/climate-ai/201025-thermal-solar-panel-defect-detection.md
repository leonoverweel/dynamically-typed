️[Montañez et al.
(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07356?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) have developed a method and GUI-enabled application for automatically segmenting defects in solar PV modules from thermal images captured using drones.
As [over 100 gigawatts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/solar-and-wind-power-top-growth-in-renewable-energy-worldwide?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) of new solar power installations are being deployed across the world every year, AI-enabled products like this will become more and more useful.
