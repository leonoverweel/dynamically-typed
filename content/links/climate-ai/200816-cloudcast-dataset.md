️New dataset from Nielsen et al. (2020): [CloudCast: A Satellite-Based Dataset and Baseline for Forecasting Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07978?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is “the first publicly available dataset with high-resolution cloud types on a high temporal granularity to the authors’ best knowledge.” The dataset has over 70k images, each annotated with 10 different cloud types, that were recoded in 15-minute increments from January 1st, 2017 to December 31st, 2018.
Sounds like it could be very useful for solar PV nowcasting models ([DT #18](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/18-runway-ml-s-app-store-for-ai-google-s-new-youtube-dataset-and-a-trippy-gan-journey-188184?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [#40](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/40-pinterest-s-ml-for-board-organization-gan-aided-pixel-art-and-bayesian-optimization-gets-the-distill-treatment-247582?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
