[Omdena](https://omdena.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), another platform “where AI engineers and domain experts collaborate to build solutions to real-world problems,” hosted a competition together with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to predict forced displacement, violent conflicts, and climate change in Somalia.
The resulting models can be used to help optimize the allocation of resources.
The competition has finished and the [result are available here](https://omdena.com/projects/ai-climate-change/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
