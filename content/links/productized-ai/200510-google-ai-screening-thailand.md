title: Google's AI screening tool in Thailand
---

Emma Beede conducted a user study on [how nurses in Thailand are using Google’s AI screening tool](https://blog.google/technology/health/healthcare-ai-systems-put-people-center/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to help diagnose diabetic retinopathy.
“[The] study found that the AI system could empower nurses to confidently and immediately identify a positive screening, resulting in quicker referrals to an ophthalmologist.” Beede emphasizes, though, that it’s important to engage with clinicians and patients before widely deploying such systems, to ensure it doesn’t inadvertently hinder diagnosis.
