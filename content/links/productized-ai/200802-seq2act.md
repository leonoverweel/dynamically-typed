Google open-sourced [Seq2act](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/seq2act?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [a new model](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/grounding-natural-language-instructions.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) that translates natural-language instructions (“How do I turn on Dutch subtitles on YouTube?”) into mobile UI action sequences (tap the video; tap the settings button; tap closed captions; select Dutch from the list).
This isn’t quite productized yet, but who wants to bet that the next major version of Android will allow you to say “OK Google, turn on Dutch subtitles” in the YouTube app—as well as millions of other commands in other apps—and that the phone will just tap the right buttons in the background and do it for you?
This is the stuff that makes me jealous as an iPhone user.
