Interesting case study from Amnesty International on using automated satellite image classification for human rights research in war zones: tens of thousands of volunteers labeled 2.6 million image tiles of the [Darfur region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in western Sudan as _empty_ , _human presence,_ or _destroyed,_ which Amnesty and Element AI researchers used to train a model that could predict these labels at 85% precision and 81% recall on the test set.
This model then allowed them to visualize and analyze different waves of destruction in the zone over time.
The [full case study](https://citizenevidence.org/2020/07/06/using-artificial-intelligence-to-scale-up-human-rights-research-a-case-study-on-darfur/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is well worth a read: it includes detailed notes on the ethical tradeoffs they considered _before starting the project_ â€”a contrast with the ethics sections in many recent ML papers that read like checkbox afterthoughts.
