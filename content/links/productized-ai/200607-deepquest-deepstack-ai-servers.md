title: DeepQuest DeepStack AI servers
---

️ DeepQuest’s [DeepStack AI Servers](https://deepquestai.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) offer a different twist on machine learning APIs: instead of just being available as endpoints in the cloud (like Google’s, Microsoft’s and Amazon’s ML APIs), DeepStack’s servers and pretrained models can be installed as Docker containers.
This way it combines the ease-of-use of cloud APIs with the data privacy of self-hosting—a cool idea I hadn’t heard of before.
