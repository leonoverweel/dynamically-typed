Depending on the severity of the bypass, this process sometimes has to be completed in mere hours or days.
In light of, well, the state of the world, the stakes here are obviously very high—I don’t envy the pressure these ML teams must be under.

The team tries to hack the company’s own AI-powered filtering systems before users do, to always stay one step ahead of them.
