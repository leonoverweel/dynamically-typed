_Yours truly, now with mustache, beard, and brows._

Cyril Diagne, resident artist/designer/programmer at Google Arts & Culture, built [**AR Face Doodle**](https://cyrildiagne.github.io/ar-facedoodle/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) **—a website that lets you draw on your face in 3D.**
It’s powered by [MediaPipe Facemesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), “a lightweight machine learning pipeline predicting 486 3D facial landmarks to infer the approximate surface geometry of a human face,” which can run real-time in browsers using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
The site lets you draw squiggles on top of your selfie camera feed and then locks them to the closest point on your face.
As you move your face around—or even scrunch it up—the doodles stick to their places and move around in 3D remarkably well.
[AR Face Doodle](https://cyrildiagne.github.io/ar-facedoodle?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) should work on any modern browser; you can also check out the site’s code on GitHub: [cyrildiagne/ar-facedoodle](https://github.com/cyrildiagne/ar-facedoodle?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
