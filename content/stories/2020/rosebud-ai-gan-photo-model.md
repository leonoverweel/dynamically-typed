_None of these models exist. (Rosebud AI)_

[**Rosebud AI**](https://www.generative.photos/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) **uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize photos of fake people for ads.**
We’ve of course seen a lot of GAN face generation in the past (see [DT #6](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/6-deep-reinforcement-learning-from-an-atari-zoo-to-a-self-driving-car-in-20-minutes-155882?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [#8](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/8-should-openai-open-source-their-impressive-new-language-model-161119?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [#23](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/23-robotic-raspberry-and-lettuce-pickers-2-5-billion-objects-in-pinterest-lens-and-an-analysis-of-the-ai-reproducibility-crisis-199555?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), but this is one of the first startups I’ve come across that’s building a product around it.
Their pitch to advertisers is simple: take photos from your previous photoshoots, and we’ll automatically swap out the model’s face with one better suited to the demographic you’re targeting.
The new face can either be GAN-generated or licensed from real models on the [generative.photos platform](https://www.generative.photos/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
But either way, Rosebud AI’s software takes care of inserting the face in a natural-looking way.

This raises some obvious questions: is it OK to advertise using nonexistent people?
Do you need models’ explicit consent to reuse their body with a new face?
How does copyright work when your model is half real, half generated?
I’m sure Rosebud AI’s founders spend a lot of time thinking about these questions; and as they do, you can follow their along with their thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rosebud_AI?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/generative.photos/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
