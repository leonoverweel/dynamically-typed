_Light direction is one of many new AI-powered features in Photoshop; in the middle picture, the light source is on the left; in the right picture, it's moved to the right._

**Adobe’s latest Photoshop release is**[ **jam-packed with AI-powered features**](https://blog.adobe.com/en/2020/10/20/photoshop-the-worlds-most-advanced-ai-application-for-creatives.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)**.**
The pitch, by product manager Pam Clark:

> You already rely on artificial intelligence features in Photoshop to speed your work every day like Select Subject, Object Selection Tool, Content-Aware Fill, Curvature Pen Tool, many of the font features, and more.
> Our goal is to systematically replace time-intensive steps with smart, automated technology wherever possible.
> With the addition of these five major new breakthroughs, you can free yourself from the mundane, non-creative tasks and focus on what matters most – your creativity.

Adobe is branding the most exciting of these new features as [Neural Filters](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/neural-filters.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) _:_ neural-network-powered image manipulations that are parameterized by sliders in the Photoshop UI.
Some of them automate tasks that were previously very labor-intensive, while others enable changes that were previously impossible.
Here’s a few of both:

* **Style transfer:** apply one photo’s style to another, like the classic “[make this look like a Picasso / Van Gogh / Monet](https://genekogan.com/works/style-transfer/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).”
* **Smart portraits:** subtly change a photo subject’s age, expression, gaze direction, pose, hair thickness, etc.
* **Colorize:** infer colors for black-and-white photos based on their contents.
* **JPEG Artifacts Removal:** smooth out the blocky artifacts that occur on patches of JPEG-compressed photos.

These all run on-device and came out of a collaboration between [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and NVIDIA, implying they’re best suited to machines with beefy GPUs — not surprising.
However, the blog post is a little vague in about the specifics here (“performance is particularly fast on desktops and notebooks with graphics acceleration”), so I wonder whether this Neural Filters is also optimized for any _other_ AI accelerator chips that Adobe can’t mention yet.
In particular, Apple recently showed off their new A14 chips that feature [a much faster Neural Engine](https://www.macworld.com/article/3575331/a14-bionic-faq-performance-features-cpu-gpu-neural-engine.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#toc-4).
These chips launched in the latest iPhones and iPads but will also be in a new line of non-Intel “Apple Silicon” Macs, rumored to be announced next month — what are the chances that Apple will boast about the performance of Neural Filters on the Neural Engine during the presentation?
I’d say pretty big.
(Maybe [worthy of a Ricky](https://www.relay.fm/connected/315?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), even?)

Anyway, this Photoshop release is exactly the kind of productized AI that I started DT to cover: advanced machine learning models — that only a few years ago were just cool demos at conferences — wrapped up in intuitive UIs that fit into users’ existing workflows.
It’s now just as easy to tweak the intensity of a smile or the direction of a gaze in a portrait photo as it is to manipulate its hue or brightness.
That’s pretty amazing.
