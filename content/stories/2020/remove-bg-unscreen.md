_Landing page for unscreen_

**Unscreen is a new zero-click tool for automatically removing the background from videos.**
It’s the next project from [Kaleido](https://www.kaleido.ai/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), the company behind [remove.bg](http://remove.bg/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), which I’ve covered extensively on Dynamically Typed: from their initial free launch ([DT #3](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/3-happy-holidays-149573?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) and Golden Kitty award ([DT #5](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/5-hey-google-what-s-a-golden-kitty-153366?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), to the launch of their paid photoshop plugin ([DT #12](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/12-openai-introduces-mozart-to-lady-gaga-and-google-takes-your-best-duck-face-selfies-for-you-173114?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) and cat support (yes, really: [DT #16](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/16-finding-whales-with-ai-and-97-pages-of-ml-for-climate-change-183400?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).

Unscreen is another great example of a highly-targeted, easy-to-use AI product, and I’m excited to see it evolve—probably following a similar path to remove.bg, since they’ve already pre-announced their HD, watermark-free pro plan [on the launch site](https://www.unscreen.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
