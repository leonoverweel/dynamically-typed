Jaime Lien and Nicholas Gillion wrote [an interesting story for the Google AI blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/soli-radar-based-perception-and.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) about how their Soli radar-based perception features went from a chunky prototype in the companyâ€™s Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) lab to a tiny chip shipping in Pixel 4 phones.
It involved a combination of creating and shipping a novel sensor, as well as designing machine learning models to power Motion Sense, the feature that recognizes hand gestures from radar data.
