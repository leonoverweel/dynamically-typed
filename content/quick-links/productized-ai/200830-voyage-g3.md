Voyage has put up [a detailed blog post announcing the G3](https://news.voyage.auto/introducing-the-voyage-g3-robotaxi-8f8772094193?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), its next-generation robotaxi aimed at senior citizens.
Although the company is not quite as far along as Waymo, [which has had customers riding their driverless taxis for over a year now](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/hailing-a-driverless-ride-in-a-waymo/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), Voyage’s service should be live in San Jose, California, next year.
I’ve been following this company for a while now and I thought I had featured them on DT at least once before, but my archive appears to disagree with me there.
To rectify that, here are some more high-quality technical blog posts from Voyage that I’ve read but never get around to covering: one on their [automatic emergency braking system](https://news.voyage.auto/a-supercharged-automatic-emergency-braking-system-6f01baeb116b?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), one on their [active learning data curation](https://news.voyage.auto/active-learning-and-why-not-all-data-is-created-equal-8a43a758c6f9?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and one on their [Telessist remote operations solution](https://news.voyage.auto/introducing-voyage-telessist-a085e4c1f691?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
