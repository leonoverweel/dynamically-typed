title: Under-display selfie cameras
---

Not _quite_ productized yet, but an example of work I’m seeing more and more of on new arXiv uploads lately: [Deep Atrous Guided Filter for Image Restoration in Under Display Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06229?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) — using AI to make photos taken _through_ phone screens look decent.
The recent activity was probably due to the [RLQ ECCV challenge](https://rlq-tod.github.io?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in August, but it’s making me wonder if in-display selfie cameras will go mainstream in the next year or two.
([Xiaomi is already hyping it up](https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-what-xiaomis-first-phone-display-selfie-camera-might-look?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).)
