title: Google ML Engineering deep dive
---

Long (technical) deep-dive from Google on their lessons learned in a decade of software engineering for machine learning systems: [Towards ML Engineering: A Brief History Of TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02013?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
A recurring theme for those of you that have been reading DT for a while: “We also recommend that before focusing on cutting-edge ML modeling techniques, product leaders should invest more time in adopting interoperable ML platforms for their organizations.”
