[Descript has launched their new video editor](https://medium.com/descript/introducing-descript-video-screen-recorder-2b195dbff85f?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
This is another DT-favorite: Descript originally built an app that lets you edit the transcribed text of an audio file and reflects those changes back into the audio (see [DT #18](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/18-runway-ml-s-app-store-for-ai-google-s-new-youtube-dataset-and-a-trippy-gan-journey-188184?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), followed by a version of the product optimized for podcast editing ([#24](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/24-descript-s-new-podcast-studio-tensorflow-and-pytorch-updates-and-more-climate-resources-202035?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
The newest release turns the app into a fully-fledged video editor, including support for Descript’s core transcript-based editing feature: it can delete sections, auto-remove “uhm"s, and even generate new audio (in the speaker’s voice!) for small corrections.
And it comes with [a great launch video](https://youtu.be/Bl9wqNe5J8U?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ([by Sandwich](https://sandwich.co?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), of course).
