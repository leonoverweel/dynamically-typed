title: Facial recognition false arrest
---

In related news, a Michigan man was [arrested because a facial recognition algorithm misidentified him](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
This is the first time a facial-recognition-induced wrongful arrest has been reported, which actually slightly surprises me because the technology has been rolled out much more widely in China (although cases like this may not make the news there).
Whatâ€™s less surprising is that this first case happened to a Black man, given that commercial facial recognition algorithms have been shown to make more mistakes on people with darker skin (see [DT #41](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/41-black-lives-matter-highlighting-ml-ai-products-research-and-climate-projects-by-black-creators-251381?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
