title: Facial recognition remains biased
---

‚Äçü¶± Your weekly reminder that anyone who tries to sell you a facial recognition system without any age, gender, racial or accessory biases, probably does not actually have such a system to sell to you.
From the 1800 submissions to the FairFace Challenge at ECCV 2020, [Sixta et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07838?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) found that: ‚Äú[the] top-10 teams [show] higher false positive rates (and lower false negative rates) for females with dark skin tone as well as the potential of eyeglasses and young age to increase the false positive rates too.‚Äù
I really hope that everyone deploying these systems widely is aware of this and the potential consequences.
