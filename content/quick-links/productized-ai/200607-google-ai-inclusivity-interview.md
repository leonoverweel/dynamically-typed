title: Google AI inclusivity interview

🏾‍💻 Andrea Lewis Åkerman [interviewed Tiffany Deng, Tulsee Doshi and Timnit Gebru](https://blog.google/technology/ai/googlers-leading-machine-learning-fairness/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) on their work at Google to make the company’s AI products more inclusive.
_“Why is it that some products and services work better for some than others, and why isn’t everyone represented around the table when a decision is being made?”_ They emphasize the importance of tooling and resources, the difficulty of even _defining_ fairness, and the necessity of diversity in both data and teams.
I found their journeys toward their positions at Google—each noticing inequalities in tech and wanting to help fix them—especially eye-opening.
