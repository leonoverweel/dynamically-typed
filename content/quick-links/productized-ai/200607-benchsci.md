[BenchSci](https://www.benchsci.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) helps life science companies reduce failed experiments by curating reagent catalogs and experiments from the literature, decoding them using ML models, and wrapping the resulting data in an easy-to-use interface for researchers.
This is the classic productized AI model of (1) automating graduate-student-level work, (2) applying it across the corpus of literature in some niche, and then (3) selling access to the extracted info as a service.
Iâ€™m personally a big fan of this model and think it has the potential to make many industries more efficient; VCs seem to agree, since BenchSci recently [raised a $22 million round of funding](https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/04/benchsci-raises-22-million-for-ai-powered-drug-discovery-tools/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
