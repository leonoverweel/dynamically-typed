Samuel Axon wrote an in-depth feature on [machine learning at Apple](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/?utm_brand=ars&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=social&utm_social-type=owned&utm_source=twitter) for Ars Technica, with input from two executives at the company: John Giannandrea (SVP for ML and AI Strategy) and Bob Borchers (VP of Product Marketing).
From handwriting recognition to battery charging optimization, AI has—[Software 2.0-style](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)—steadily been eating its way into more and more of the iOS software stack, far beyond just powering the obvious things like Siri speech recognition and camera roll semantic search.
Of course, Giannandrea and Borchers also talk a lot about Apple’s focus on on-device ML and their “neural engine” accelerator chips.
It’s a long article, but a must-read if you’re into productized AI.
