I recently came across Martin Zinkevich’s 24-page [Rules of Machine Learning](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (PDF), “intended to help those with a basic knowledge of machine learning get the benefit of best practices in machine learning from around Google.” Lots of good stuff in here.
