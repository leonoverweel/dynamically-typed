Lee shared his experience of [getting a burger delivered by a robot](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/the-pandemic-is-bringing-us-closer-to-our-robot-takeout-future/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Part-self-driving and part-piloted, these box-on-wheels sidewalk robots by startups like Starship and Kiwibot are getting pretty clever.
