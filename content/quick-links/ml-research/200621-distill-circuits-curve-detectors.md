title: Curve detectors in CNNs
---

Nick Cammarata et al.
published [a new article on curve detectors](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/curve-detectors/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in [Distill’s Circuits thread](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (see [DT #35](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/35-completely-automatic-video-background-removal-with-unscreen-and-circuits-for-understanding-neural-networks-230458?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [#37](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/37-openai-s-neural-network-taxonomy-decoding-text-from-brain-implants-and-models-that-don-t-exist-236677?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
It’s a deep dive into the 3b:379 neuron of the InceptionV1 network, and—as usual—it’s an exceptionally well-written and well-illustrated post.
I also really like the idea of a CNN learning how to do e.g.
curve detection (which hasn’t been solved classically!), and then teaching us how to implement it by hand.
Goes to show the power of the Circuits hypothesis.
