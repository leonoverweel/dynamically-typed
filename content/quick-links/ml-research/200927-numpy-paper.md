The NumPy paper is out!
It’s a Nature article by [Harris et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Is this going to break records in citation counts, as pretty much every machine learning paper should probably be referencing it?
Either way, I’ve [updated](https://github.com/leonoverweel/bibtex-python-package-citations/commit/b860b032d532a6732a47d1cfd3729a73516f0aba?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) my [repo of BibTex citations for Python packages](https://github.com/leonoverweel/bibtex-python-package-citations?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to add it.
