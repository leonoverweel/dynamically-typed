OpenAI [released an analysis](https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) showing that “since 2012 the amount of compute needed to train a neural net to the same performance on ImageNet classification has been decreasing by a factor of 2 every 16 months.
Compared to 2012, it now takes 44 times less compute to train a neural network to the level of AlexNet” (Hernandez and Brown, 2020).
