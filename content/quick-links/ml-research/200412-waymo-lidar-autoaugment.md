Shuyang Cheng et al. at self-driving car company Waymo have extended Google’s reinforcement-learned image data augmentation technique, [AutoAugment](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/06/improving-deep-learning-performance.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), to work with [LIDAR data](https://blog.waymo.com/2020/04/using-automated-data-augmentation-to.html?m=1&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Elon Musk still believes LIDAR sensors are [useless “appendices”](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for self-driving cars but the rest of the industry, Waymo included, is evidently not getting anywhere closer to agreeing with that thesis.
