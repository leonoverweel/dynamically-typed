title: Decoding brain signals into text
---

Neurologists Joseph Makin et al. at UC San Francisco used a-250 electrode brain implant to [decode human brain signals into text](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/708206v1?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) with techniques from machine translation—at a word error rate of only 3%.
The implant technology [won’t be widely usable anytime soon](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22736681&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), if ever, but you can download the code it runs on anyway: [jgmakin/machine_learning](https://github.com/jgmakin/machine_learning?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
