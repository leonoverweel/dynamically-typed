Googleâ€™s [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ([DT #15](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/15-neural-avatars-ai-on-the-edge-and-apple-s-new-create-ml-app-180967?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) now contains over 31 million datasets, a tripling since its initial launch two years ago.
Natasha Noy and Omar Benjelloun wrote up an [analysis of the types of datasets that are now available](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/08/an-analysis-of-online-datasets-using.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for the Google AI blog.
Social science plus geoscience make up almost half the datasets, and together with biology, agriculture, and medicine, they comprise three quarters.
The post also includes some best practices for publishing datasets so that Dataset Search can properly index them for other researchers to find.
