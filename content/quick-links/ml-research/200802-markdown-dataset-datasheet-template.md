title: Markdown dataset datasheet template
---

️ Josh Meyer has created [a handy markdown template](https://github.com/JRMeyer/markdown-datasheet-for-datasets/blob/master/DATASHEET.md?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for creating datasheets for datasets (see [DT #41](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/41-black-lives-matter-highlighting-ml-ai-products-research-and-climate-projects-by-black-creators-251381?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
This would’ve come in very handy a month ago when I was writing a dataset datasheet at work and copying over all the questions from the PDF of [Gebru et al.
(2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) by hand.
