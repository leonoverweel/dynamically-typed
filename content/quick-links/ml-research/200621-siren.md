Vincent Sitzmann et al.
introduced [SIREN, a new activation function for implicit neural representations](https://vsitzmann.github.io/siren/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), a technique to encode a signal (e.g.
an image, audio sample, video clip, or 3D scenes) in the parameters of a neural network.
Their main innovation is using a _periodic_ activation function (based on a sine wave) instead of the usual ReLU, TanH, or Softplus nonlinearities, which yields very impressive results.
