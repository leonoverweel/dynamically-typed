[Broxton et al.
(2020)](https://storage.googleapis.com/immersive-lf-video-siggraph2020/ImmersiveLightFieldVideoWithALayeredMeshRepresentation.pdf?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) extended [DeepView](https://augmentedperception.github.io/deepview/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), their previous gradient-based method to render new perspectives of 3D scenes, into the video domain with [DeepViewVideo](https://augmentedperception.github.io/deepviewvideo/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
This is very cool: as you’re watching a video, you can virtually pan and tilt the “camera” through which you’re watching the scene to see it from different angles.
Their method enables doing this efficiently enough that it can run in browsers and on mobile phones.
Check out the sample video at the top of [the excellent webpage for the paper](https://augmentedperception.github.io/deepviewvideo/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to get a feel for the effect.
