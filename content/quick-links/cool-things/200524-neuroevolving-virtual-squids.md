title: Neuroevolving virtual squids
---

Job Talle used spiking neural networks and neuroevolution to [create digital squids that learn how to swim](https://jobtalle.com/neuroevolution_in_squids.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Check out [the demo on his site](https://jobtalle.com/Cephalopods/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter); let it “warp” to about generation #1000 and then watch how the different squids learned (and failed to learn) to swim in different ways.
I always think demos like this would be super cool to stylize and project on my wall as an ever-changing piece of art.
One day.
