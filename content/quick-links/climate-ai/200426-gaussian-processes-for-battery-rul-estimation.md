title: Gaussian processes for battery RUL estimation
---

In [a new paper for Nature, Zhang et al.
(2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15235-7?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) used Gaussian processes to forecast the health and remaining useful life (RUL) of Lithium-ion batteries, the type of battery used in smartphones and electric cars, based on real-time, non-invasive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements.
Reliable EIS-based RUL estimation can be used to improve the usability and recyclability of these batteries, which will be critical as we electrify the economy.
