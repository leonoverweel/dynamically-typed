title: Pixel 4 uDepth deep dive

Michael Schoenberg and Adarsh Kowdle wrote a [deep dive on uDepth](http://ai.googleblog.com/2020/04/udepth-real-time-3d-depth-sensing-on.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), the set of neural networks on Google’s Pixel 4 phones that enable some cool computational photography features and a real-time depth sensing API at 30 Hz.
Fun bonus: their architecture diagram also highlights whether each step runs on the phone’s CPU, GPU, or Neural Core.
