Naveen Arivazhagan and Colin Cherry wrote [a post for the Google AI Blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/01/stabilizing-live-speech-translation-in.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) about how they solved a problem with the live speech translation feature in Google Translate: translations would frequently get updated as more of the transcribed text became available, which users found distracting.
Itâ€™s a cool glimpse into all the stuff besides just model accuracy and speed that are important to get right for a successful AI-powered product, and into how engineers think about turning these nonfunctional requirements into measurable performance metics they can optimize for.
