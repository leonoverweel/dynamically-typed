title: Live (jargon) transcription in Microsoft Teams
---

[Microsoft Teams now has a live meeting transcription feature](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/live-transcription-with-speaker-attribution-now-available-in/ba-p/2228817?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), launching first for US-English-speaking users.
Microsoft’s implementation here is quite impressive: beyond the basics like speaker attribution and saving the transcript for access after the meeting, the feature “uses a meeting’s invitation, participant names, attachments, etc.
to improve the accuracy and recognize meeting-specific jargon for each transcript automatically.” Really cool!
This also all happens live during the meeting, and the data isn’t saved on Microsoft’s servers after the meeting ends.
