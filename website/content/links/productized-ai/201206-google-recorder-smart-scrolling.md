title: Google Recorder Smart Scrolling
---

Recorder app for Android, which uses on-device AI to transcribe recordings (see [DT #25](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/25-ai-powered-rainforest-monitoring-google-s-pixel-4-and-openai-s-rubik-s-cube-solving-robot-hand-204685?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [#31](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/31-uber-s-generative-teaching-networks-ml-super-resolution-in-pixelmator-pro-and-evolve-energy-219307?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), now has [a new ML-powered feature: Smart Scrolling](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/11/navigating-recorder-transcripts-easily.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
The feature “automatically marks important sections in the transcript, chooses the most representative keywords from each section, and then surfaces those keywords on the vertical scrollbar, like chapter headings.” This all happens on-device.
How long until it also writes concise summaries of your hour-long recordings?
