[GPT-3, OpenAI’s language model that doesn’t need fine tuning](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/gpt-3/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), went viral on Twitter about a year ago when people showed off [demo projects in which they got it to generate code](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/gpt-3-demos-one-month-in/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter); a few months later, [OpenAI exclusively licensed the model’s underlying technology to Microsoft](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/openai-microsoft-gpt-3-license-exclusive/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
We’re now starting to see the results of both those stories: Microsoft has launched a new feature for its “low code, no code” Power Platform [that uses GPT-3 to turn natural language prompts into database query code](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451144/microsoft-gpt-3-openai-coding-autocomplete-powerapps-power-fx?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
It doesn’t get more “productized AI” than this!
