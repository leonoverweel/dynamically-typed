title: MyHeritage's Deep Nostalgia
---

This was making the rounds on Twitter: online genealogy platform MyHeritage launched a tool called [Deep Nostalgia](https://www.myheritage.com/deep-nostalgia?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) that animates faces in old family photos.
According to [the companyâ€™s blog](https://blog.myheritage.com/2021/03/deep-nostalgia-is-an-internet-sensation/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), it was used to animate over 10 million faces in its first week of being live.
As with many visual deep-learning-powered features, there is a free version with watermarks, as well as a premium version as part of a paid MyHeritage subscription.
The model behind Deep Nostalgia is licensed from [D-ID](https://www.d-id.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), a startup that makes live portrait, talking heads, and video anonymization products.
