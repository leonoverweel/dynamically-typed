[Runway ML](https://runwayml.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), the “app store” of easy-to-use machine learning models for creators (see [DT #18](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/18-runway-ml-s-app-store-for-ai-google-s-new-youtube-dataset-and-a-trippy-gan-journey-188184?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), [added a new Green Screen feature](https://twitter.com/runwayml/status/1328692635037523968?s=12&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), which it says is “[the] first real-time web tool for cutting objects out of videos.
Using machine learning, it makes rotoscoping (a.k.a.
masking) a lot faster and a lot less painful.” It looks very cool, but take their claim of being first with a grain of salt: Kaleido, the folks behind DT-favorite [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), also launched an ML-powered automatic video background removal tool called [unscreen](https://www.unscreen.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) earlier this year ([#35](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/35-completely-automatic-video-background-removal-with-unscreen-and-circuits-for-understanding-neural-networks-230458?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
However, for Runway ML, Green Screen represents yet another well-integrated feature for their already extensive AI creativity product, which is not something unscreen can match as a single-use tool.
Along with Photoshop’s new AI features ([#51](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/51-photoshop-s-new-ai-features-descript-for-video-and-ar-copy-paste-with-clipdrop-284856?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), this is yet another example of how quickly deep learning vision models are becoming easy to use for everyone.
