Cyril Diagne’s [AR cut & paste](https://twitter.com/cyrildiagne/status/1256916982764646402?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) demo ([#39](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/39-cloudflare-s-ml-to-block-bad-bots-3x-satellite-based-environmental-monitoring-and-ar-face-doodles-243752?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) is now an app: [ClipDrop](https://clipdrop.co?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) lets you take photos of objects on your phone, uses a background removal model to cut them out, and then lets you paste them onto your laptop screen in augmented reality.
I’ve tried it on a few objects I had laying around my apartment, and capturing objects (the "clip” bit) works super reliably; sending the photo to my laptop (the “drop” bit) was a bit less robust.
