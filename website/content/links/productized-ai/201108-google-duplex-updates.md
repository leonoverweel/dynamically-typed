title: Google Duplex updates

Duplex, Google’s “AI technology that uses natural conversation to get things done,” was first launched at the company’s 2018 I/O conference as a way to automatically make phone calls for reservations at restaurants or rental car services (see [DT #13](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/13-caption-this-new-ai-powered-features-at-google-i-o-and-openai-s-staged-gpt-2-release-175669?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
It’s now being used [in a lot more places](https://blog.google/technology/ai/duplex-helpful-updates/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), from calling businesses listed on Google Maps to automatically confirm their opening times, to screening potential spam phone calls.
Personally I’d feel a little rude having Duplex make a reservation for me, but I think the use case of double-checking opening times is very useful — especially now, during the pandemic — since that single automated call can prevent a lot of people from showing up to closed doors if opening times are wrong on Google Maps.
