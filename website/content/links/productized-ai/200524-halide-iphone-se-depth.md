title: Halide iPhone SE depth
---

Ben Sandofsky of iOS camera app Halide [wrote a deep dive](https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-se-the-one-eyed-king-96713d65a3b1?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) on how the new iPhone SE, which has only one rear-facing camera, uses single-image monocular depth estimation to do fake background blur in portrait mode photos.
I have some experience with this exact computer vision task, and the results achieved here by Apple—on-device!—look very impressive to me.
