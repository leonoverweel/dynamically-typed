[Lobe](https://lobe.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), a web app to visually edit high-level compute graphs of machine learning models and train them, has ([re](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lobe?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter))[launched](https://twitter.com/lobe_ai/status/1320719325804646401?s=12&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) as a Microsoft product.
“Just show it examples of what you want it to learn, and it automatically trains a custom machine learning model that can be shipped in your app.” The site’s UI looks super slick, and it can export models to TensorFlow (1.15, not 2.x), TFLite, ONNX, CoreML and more.
I’d be very interested to find out what kind of optimizations it applies for the mobile and edge deployment targets — anything on top of the standard TFLite conversion, for example?
