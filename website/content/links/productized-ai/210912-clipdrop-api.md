title: ClipDrop launches an API
---

I first covered Cyril Diagne’s [AR cut and paste](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/cool-things/200510-ar-cut-and-paste/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) tool in May 2020 when it was a cool tech demo on Twitter, and then again when he [productized it as ClipDrop](http://ClipDrop%20) in October.
As a reminder, ClipDrop lets you take a picture of an object which it then segments (“clips”) out of the background so that you can paste (“drop”) it onto a canvas on your laptop in AR.
Diagne has [kept busy](https://twitter.com/cyrildiagne/status/1435945635354759169?s=12&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) since the initial launch: he did Y Combinator, raised a seed round, and grew the team.
ClipDrop now has 11,000 paying customers; it’s also launching a new web app and an API.

It’s another great example of AI enabling creativity software — see also [Photoshop’s Neural Filters](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/photoshop-neural-filters/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Rosebud AI’s GAN photo models](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/rosebud-ai-gan-photo-model/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), all the [Spleeter-powered apps](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/one-ai-model-four-competing-services/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and of course [RunwayML](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/productized-ai/201122-runwayml-green-screen/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Descript](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/productized-ai/201025-descript-for-video/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
