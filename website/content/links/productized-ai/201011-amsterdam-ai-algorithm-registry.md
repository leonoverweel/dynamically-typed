title: Amsterdam's AI registry
---

Amsterdam (where I live!) and Helsinki (where I don’t live) have launched their “AI algorithm registries.” These are actually a pretty cool idea: whenever a municipalities “utilizes algorithmic systems as part of [their] city services,” these systems must be cataloged in the city’s algorithm registry.
[Amsterdam’s registry](https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/en/ai-register/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) currently has three entries: (1) license plate-recognizing [automated parking control](https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/automated-parking-control?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) cars, (2) a pilot for algorithm-assisted [fraud surveillance for holiday home rentals](https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/holiday-rental-housing-fraud-risk?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and (3) a natural language processing system for [categorizing reports of trash in public space](https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/en/reporting-issues-in-public-space/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
These registries may become a good source of productized AI links for me, but more importantly, this is a great step for building transparency, trust and accountability into these systems.
