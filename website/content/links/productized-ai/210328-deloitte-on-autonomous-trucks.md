title: Deloitte on autonomous trucks
---

Last September, I wrote that [autonomous trucks will be the first big self-driving market](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/autonomous-trucks-self-driving/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
A detailed new report by Deloitte’s Rasheq Zarif now came to the same conclusion: [Autonomous trucks lead the way](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/autonomous-trucks-lead-the-way.html?TrucksFoT=&utm_campaign=60f49b7466-Benedict%27s%20newsletter_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Benedict%27s%20Newsletter&utm_term=0_4999ca107f-60f49b7466-70536657).
“Driverless trucks are already heading out to the highway, as shipping companies increasingly look to autonomous technology to meet rising demand for goods.
The focus now: determining the best way to hand off trailers from machine to human.” In related news, self-driving car company Waymo, which has been developing autonomous heavy-duty trucks since 2017, [invited a few journalists along for a (virtual) test ride](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/a-virtual-test-ride-in-a-waymo-long-haul-truck?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Exciting few years ahead here.
