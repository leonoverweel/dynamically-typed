title: Oxygen Digital panel on AI-assisted coding

I joined [Oxygen Digital](https://oxygendigital.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for their _AI Series_ [panel on AI-assisted coding](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6833309529820676096/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ([YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=OMDKpYDU05M)).
To our own surprise, we filled the whole 90-minute slot — it was a lot of fun!
We discussed [GitHub Copilot and OpenAI Codex](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2021/copilot?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and lots more about the future of professional software engineering as tools like this become a part of every IDE.
As I also wrote in [Towards talking to computers with Codex](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2021/talking-with-codex/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), I’m most excited about how these code generation AI models will unlock the power of working with APIs to people who don’t know how to write code.
