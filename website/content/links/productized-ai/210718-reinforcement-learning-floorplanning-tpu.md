title: RL-based floorplans for next-gen TPUs
---

Google AI researchers Azalia Mirhoseini and Anna Goldie published a Nature paper on their [AI-powered computer chip design methodology,](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) which uses “an edge-based graph convolutional neural network architecture capable of learning rich and transferable representations of the chip.” Trained on a dataset of 10,000 chip floorplans, the method replaces “months of intense effort” for humans, and comes up with a more optimal end result.
[I covered this research](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/ml-research/200426-chip-design-with-reinforcement-learning/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) when it first came out in April 2020, but the big news now is that it has been productionized: Mirhoseini and Goldie have used it to design the next generation of Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)!
