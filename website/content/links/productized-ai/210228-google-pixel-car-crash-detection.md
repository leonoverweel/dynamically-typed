title: Google Pixel car crash detection
---

Apparently, [Google’s Pixel phones can detect car crashes](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7055029?hl=en&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
This was making the rounds on Twitter after a Reddit user wrote on r/GooglePixel that [car crash detection saved them from hours of suffering](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/lq3k0a/car_crash_detection_saved_me_hours_of_suffering/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) because they had an accident on their own property, where no one would otherwise have found them for a long time.
When the phone detects a crash, it calls local emergency services [and says](https://i.imgur.com/ChikTEx.jpg?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), “You are being contacted by an automated emergency voice service on behalf of a caller.
The caller’s phone detected a possible car crash, and they were unresponsive.
Please send help,” followed by the phone’s latest location.
Pretty amazing stuff, that’s being built into more and more products — Apple Watches have a similar [fall detection feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=jvmqqh1xIs4).
Dave Burke, Google’s VP of engineering for Android, noticed the story and [tweeted a photo of the setup they used to train the ML model powering this feature](https://twitter.com/davey_burke/status/1364276591778390016?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Worth a click.
