title: Learning to see through obstructions
---

Cool new paper from Liu et al. (2020): [Learning to See Through Obstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01180?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) proposes a learning-based approach that can remove things like chain fences and window reflections from photos (see the [paper PDF ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01180.pdf?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)for examples).
This isn’t yet productized, but of the collaborators works at Google—so: how long until this shows up up in the camera app for Pixel phones?
