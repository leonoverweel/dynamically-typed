title: Anthropic raises a Series A round
---

A lot of the people behind some of my favorite recent machine learning research (like [Circuits](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Multimodal Neurons](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/ml-research/210411-distill-multimodal-neurons/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) have joined up to form a new AI safety and research company called Anthropic, and [raised a $124 million series A round](https://www.anthropic.com/news/announcement?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) “to build more reliable, general AI systems.” I hope they keep publishing their research to Distill!
