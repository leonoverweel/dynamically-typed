title: Google's Know Your Data tool
---

Google launched [Know Your Data](https://knowyourdata.withgoogle.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), a new tool that “helps researchers, engineers, product teams, and decision makers understand datasets with the goal of improving data quality, and helping mitigate fairness and bias issues.” It includes 70+ existing image datasets for which the tool can find corrupted data, sensitive subjects, coverage gaps, and balance problems.
This looks like a solid technical step towards more equitable and reliable machine learning.
