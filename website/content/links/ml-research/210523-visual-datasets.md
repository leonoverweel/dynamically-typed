In response to the announcement that [NeurIPS 2021 will have a datasets track](https://neuripsconf.medium.com/announcing-the-neurips-2021-datasets-and-benchmarks-track-644e27c1e66c?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (cool!), Cyril Diagne wrote [a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/cyrildiagne/status/1380119711581626369?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) covering some of his favorite sources of publicly available visual datasets, including Kaggle ([646 computer vision datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), Visual Data ([527 datasets](https://www.visualdata.io/discovery?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) and Bifrost ([1900 datasets](https://datasets.bifrost.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
A great source of project inspiration!
