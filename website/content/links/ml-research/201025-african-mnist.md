[Wu et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13509?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) present four variations of the popular MNIST digit recognition for “our orthographies used in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages: Ge`ez (Ethiopic), Vai, Osmanya, and N'Ko.” They’re formatted so that they can be used as drop-in replacement for any existing MNIST model, and the authors show that LeNet achieves similar classification accuracies to classic MNIST on each of the new datasets.
The data is open-source at [Daniel-Wu/AfroMNIST](https://github.com/Daniel-Wu/AfroMNIST?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
