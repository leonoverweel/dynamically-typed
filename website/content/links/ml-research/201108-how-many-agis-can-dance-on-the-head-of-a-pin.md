title: How many AGIs can dance on the head of a pin?
---

In his follow-up to [A very short history of some times we solved AI](https://togelius.blogspot.com/2020/08/a-very-short-history-of-some-times-we.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), Julian Togelius asks [How many AGIs can dance on the head of a pin?](https://togelius.blogspot.com/2020/10/how-many-agis-can-dance-on-head-of-pin.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) Intelligence — let alone artificial general intelligence — is an extremely ill-defined concept; and the path from current machine learning software to a self-aware Terminator is… unclear, to put it mildly.
So, Togelius argues that the popular philosophical AGI debates (about how to contain or align an exponentially self-improving intelligence explosion) are completely moot.
“If you don’t believe in angels, it makes no sense discussing how much space they occupy.
It just becomes a word game.” It’s a good read that once again very much aligns with my views on AGI.
