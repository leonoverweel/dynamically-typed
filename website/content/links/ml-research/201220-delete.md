research + resource links** üéõ * üì∞ There are some new developments in Google‚Äôs ongoing AI ethics crisis (see [DT #54](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/54-google-ai-s-ethics-crisis-an-adversarial-attack-on-deepfake-detectors-and-stanford-s-ognet-climate-project-295371?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
CEO Sundar Pichai issued [a company-wide memo](https://www.axios.com/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) apologizing for the fact that ‚ÄúDr.
[Timnit] Gebru‚Äôs departure ‚Ä¶ seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google.‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt address the central issue, and it did not land well with the community; see the tweets from [Gebru](https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1336777379730116615?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Jack Clark](https://twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/1336776902099390464?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), as well as [Khari Johnson‚Äôs interview with Gebru](https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/10/timnit-gebru-googles-dehumanizing-memo-paints-me-as-an-angry-black-woman/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [NPR‚Äôs coverage of the story](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/17/947719354/ousted-black-google-researcher-they-wanted-to-have-my-presence-but-not-me-exactl?t=1608388688095&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
In response to the memo, a group of Google AI researchers sent the executives [a list of demands](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/google-ai-researchers-lay-out-demands-escalating-internal-fight?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) asking for leadership and policy changes.
And meanwhile, someone made [a fake Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mantzarlis/status/1337784486826831876?s=12&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (complete with a GAN-generated profile picture) that opposed Gebru‚Äôs side of the story by pretending to be an ex-researcher from the Google ethics team.
I don‚Äôt think this‚Äôll be resolved anytime soon.
* ‚ú≥Ô∏è Chris Olah et al.
have a cool new Distill article in the [Circuits thread](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter): [Naturally Occurring Equivariance in Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/equivariance/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
‚ÄúWe sometimes think of understanding neural nets as being like reverse engineering a regular computer program.
In this analogy, equivariance is like finding the same inlined function repeated throughout the code.‚Äù
