[PlotNeuralNet](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is an open-source LaTeX package for drawing deep neural networks, also featuring a Python wrapper.
Iâ€™ve spent hours doing this by hand in Figma in the past, so this is a very welcome change.
(Thanks for the tip, Tim!)
