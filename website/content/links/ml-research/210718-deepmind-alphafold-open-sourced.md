AlphaFold, DeepMind’s protein folding neural network that [represented a breakthrough in structural biology](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/deepmind-alphafold-2/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), is now open-source.
The model’s paper, _Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold_ by [Jumper et al.
(2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), got published in Nature; the code is on GitHub at [deepmind/alphafold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Lots of people in the community were asking for this.
