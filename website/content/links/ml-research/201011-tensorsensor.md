[TensorSensor](https://github.com/parrt/tensor-sensor?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a Python package that “clarifies” (visualizes) the dimensions of tensors in numpy, TensorFlow or PyTorch.
I recently had to reproduce a paper that wrote down its math in a simplified form that ignored the out-channel dimension of convolutional filters, and spent a lot of time trying to get all my matrices to line up correctly with that extra dimension.
This tool would’ve made that a lot easier!
