Cool new [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) feature: [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)-discovered implementations [are now linked right on a paper’s abstract page](https://twitter.com/paperswithcode/status/1314214449083895808?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
I’ve always found it quite easy to find any available implementations with a few quick Google and GitHub searches, but integrations like this are great for discoverability.
