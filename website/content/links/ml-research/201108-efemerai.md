[Efemerai](https://efemarai.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a tool to visualize, inspect and debug deep learning code.
The visualization bit looks coolest: “Efemarai can scan the execution of your machine learning code and automatically generate interactive 3D visualizations.
All you need is a single line of Python to explore the entire computational graph of your model with all of its values, parameters and gradients.”
