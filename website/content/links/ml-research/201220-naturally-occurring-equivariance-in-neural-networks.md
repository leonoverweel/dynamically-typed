title: Naturally Occurring Equivariance in Neural Networks
---

Chris Olah et al.
have a cool new Distill article in the [Circuits thread](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter): [Naturally Occurring Equivariance in Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/equivariance/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
“We sometimes think of understanding neural nets as being like reverse engineering a regular computer program.
In this analogy, equivariance is like finding the same inlined function repeated throughout the code.”
