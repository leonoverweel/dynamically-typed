[Cool video demo of speech recognition for overlapping voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=kOqYEWLuAZQ) by Google AI’s Quan Wang: [VoiceFilter-Lite](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/11/improving-on-device-speech-recognition.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) lets users enroll their voices on their phones (“this is my phone, please remember my voice”) and is then very accurately able to filter out other peoples’ voices while transcribing text.
This all happens on-device and has super low latencies.
