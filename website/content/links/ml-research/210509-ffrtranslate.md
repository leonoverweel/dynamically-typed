title: 'FFRTranslate: Fon-to-French translation'
---

As part of [their earlier research project](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/ml-research/200607-fon-to-french/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to translate Fon — a language spoken by two million people across Benin, Nigeria and Togo — to French, Bonaventure Dossou and Chris Emezue built [FFRTranslate.com](https://www.ffrtranslate.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
They’ve wrapped their neural machine translation model into an easy-to-use website for translating back and forth between the two languages, and both the model and dataset are open-source on GitHub at [bonaventuredossou/ffr-v1](https://github.com/bonaventuredossou/ffr-v1?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Dossou and Emezue are both MSc students and they’ve so far paid for the server costs of this project out of pocket.
They set up a [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/9fff11fa?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ffrtranslate?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to help with the ongoing costs; I donated $20 through the latter and encourage you to also chip in if you can.
(For Dutch readers: the iDEAL option on GoFundMe doesn’t work because the project isn’t Dutch, and the website silently fails if you try to use it.)
