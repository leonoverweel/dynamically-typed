[An Image is Worth 16x16 words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a paper under review for ICLR 2020 that’s been [making the rounds on Twitter](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1312279279741276161?s=12&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
I found [Yannick Kilcher’s explainer video](https://youtu.be/TrdevFK_am4?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) — which starts with a lovely rant about “double-blind” peer review — a good introduction to the model, which could be the start of Transformers overtaking convolutional models at the very largest scales of computer vision models.
