title: Distill long reads

Three new long reads on Distill: a bit of a meta article about how they think about [Visualizing Weights](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/visualizing-weights/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), which has been an important feature in lots of the publication’s recent articles; a new entry to the [Circuits thread](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) on reverse-engineering [Curve Circuits](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/curve-circuits/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter); and an application of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) for generating [Self-Organizing Textures](https://distill.pub/selforg/2021/textures/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
That last one features a fun interactive graphic at the top.
I didn’t get around to reading these in detail before sending out today’s DT — they’re quite long — but wanted to share them anyways.
