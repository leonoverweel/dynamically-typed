title: New AI ethics team at Google Research
---

I wrote about [Google’s AI ethics crisis](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2020/google-ai-ethics-crisis/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) last December, when the company pushed out their Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team’s co-lead Timnit Gebru after a series of conflicts around a critical paper she was working on.
Her dismissal [was not received well](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/ml-research/201220-google-ai-ethics-crisis-updates/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) by her team and the community at large.
A few months later, [Google also fired Margaret Mitchell](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56135817?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), the team’s other co-lead.
And now it seems that the dust has settled a bit, internally at least: according to [a post on Google’s The Keyword blog](https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), Dr.
Marian Croak, long-time VP at the company, “has created and will lead a new center of expertise on responsible AI within Google Research.” I wonder how much of Gebru’s and Mitchell’s original team is sticking around for this new group — the researchers who spoke out publicly did not seem to have much faith left in their ability to work on ethical AI issues from inside Google.
