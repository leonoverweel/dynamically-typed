Cool new dataset by Zhou et al.
(2020): [HoliCity: A City-Scale Data Platform for Learning Holistic 3D Structures](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~zyc/holicity/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Covering a 20-square-kilometer area of central London, it aligns 6,300 high-resolution panorama photos with a 3D CAD model of the city, “with the ultimate goal of supporting real-world applications including city-scale reconstruction, localization, mapping, and augmented reality.” The [dataset’s website](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~zyc/holicity/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) includes a few samples with interactive sliders between their RGB, plane, CAD, and semantic views.
