title: Google AI ethics crisis updates
---

There are some new developments in Google’s ongoing AI ethics crisis (see [DT #54](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/54-google-ai-s-ethics-crisis-an-adversarial-attack-on-deepfake-detectors-and-stanford-s-ognet-climate-project-295371?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
CEO Sundar Pichai issued [a company-wide memo](https://www.axios.com/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) apologizing for the fact that “Dr.
[Timnit] Gebru’s departure … seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google.” This doesn’t address the central issue, and it did not land well with the community; see the tweets from [Gebru](https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1336777379730116615?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Jack Clark](https://twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/1336776902099390464?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), as well as [Khari Johnson’s interview with Gebru](https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/10/timnit-gebru-googles-dehumanizing-memo-paints-me-as-an-angry-black-woman/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [NPR’s coverage of the story](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/17/947719354/ousted-black-google-researcher-they-wanted-to-have-my-presence-but-not-me-exactl?t=1608388688095&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
In response to the memo, a group of Google AI researchers sent the executives [a list of demands](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/google-ai-researchers-lay-out-demands-escalating-internal-fight?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) asking for leadership and policy changes.
And meanwhile, someone made [a fake Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mantzarlis/status/1337784486826831876?s=12&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (complete with a GAN-generated profile picture) that opposed Gebru’s side of the story by pretending to be an ex-researcher from the Google ethics team.
I don’t think this’ll be resolved anytime soon.
