_ML resource:_ Published at ICLR 2021, [Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges](https://geometricdeeplearning.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a free 150-page proto-book by Bronstein et al.
(2021) that “attempts to distill ‘all you need to build the architectures that are all you need.’” They express popular architectures like CNNs, GNNs, Transformers and LSTMs all using a common geometric blueprint.
