title: Papers with Code reproducibility reports
---

[Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) has a new [feature to link papers to independent reproducibility reports](https://twitter.com/paperswithcode/status/1400428318898495494?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) done as part of their ML Reproducibility Challenge ([RC2020](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) event, which now covers NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, CVPR and ECCV.
Both in university and at my previous and current jobs, paper reproductions have always been some of my favorite learning experiences: you don’t truly understand a paper (and the math inside it) until you’ve coded it up and gotten it to perform similarly to the original!
It’s great to see some more formal infrastructure being built up around this practice, now including Papers with Code’s recurring event, standardized reports, and cross-linking.
