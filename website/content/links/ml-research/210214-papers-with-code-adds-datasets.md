---

[Papers with Code](https://www.paperswithcode.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is continuing on its quest to index more and more aspects of machine learning research.
They’ve now [launched](https://twitter.com/paperswithcode/status/1356627009791807489?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) a new [Datasets section](https://www.paperswithcode.com/datasets?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) that lets you search benchmarks by the dataset and modality they’re based on.
The [page for ImageNet](https://www.paperswithcode.com/dataset/imagenet?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), for example, has a description, samples, usage statistics and metadata about the dataset, and links to 52 related benchmarks.
Papers with Code’s execution has been impressive lately: in the last year and a half, they’ve also launched [sotabench](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/stories/2019/papers-with-code-sotabench/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Methods](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/stories/2020/papers-with-code-methods-knowledge-graph/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [arXiv integration](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/ml-research/201011-arxiv-and-papers-with-code/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Axcell](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/ml-research/200510-papers-with-code-axcell/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
These are all useful resources, and it seems their acquisition by Facebook in the middle of it all hasn’t slowed the team down one bit!
