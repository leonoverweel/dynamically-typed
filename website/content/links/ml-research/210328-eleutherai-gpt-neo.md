title: EleutherAI's OSS GPT-Neo reproduction
---

[EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), “a grassroots collection of researchers working to open source AI research,” has scaled its [open-source GPT-Neo implementation](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) up to GPT-3 size.
The weights are available to download for free, and you can play around with the pretrained models [in an example Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EleutherAI/GPTNeo/blob/master/GPTNeo_example_notebook.ipynb?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Yay open science!
Now that I’ve run out of free GPT-3 credits on the OpenAI API, maybe I’ll be able to use this to generate new content for [This Episode Does Not Exist!](https://thisepisodedoesnotexist.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) — drop me a message if you’d like me to try it out for your favorite podcast.
