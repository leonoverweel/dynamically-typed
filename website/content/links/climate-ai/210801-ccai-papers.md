After [launching their wiki last month](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/climate-ai/210718-climate-change-ai-wiki/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), Climate Change AI has now set up a [workshop papers repository](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) featuring the work presented at all eight previous [Tackling Climate Change with AI events](https://www.climatechange.ai/events?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#past-events), held across conferences like ICML, ICLR and NeurIPS.
All papers are tagged with searchable subject areas and whether the paper won an award.
The [power and energy tag](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers.html?areas=Power%20and%20energy&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), for example, will be a great source for our literature reviews at Dexter!
