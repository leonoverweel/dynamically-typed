title: Tree Canopy Lab in Los Angeles
---

For Google’s The Keyword blog, Alicia Cormie wrote about how Los Angeles’ first-ever City Forest Officer Rachel Malarich is using the company’s [Tree Canopy Lab](https://blog.google/products/earth/helping-cities-seed-new-trees-with-tree-canopy-lab/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to [decide where to plant trees](https://blog.google/products/earth/rachel-malarich-planting-better-future/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Tree Canopy Lab uses satellite imagery to automatically map a city’s tree cover density in different areas, which Cormie uses to find the communities most in need of more trees.
Trees in cities are awesome: they improve air quality and reduce the effects of extreme climate change-induced heat.
Plant more trees in cities!
It’s great to see an ML-powered project being used to help with this.
