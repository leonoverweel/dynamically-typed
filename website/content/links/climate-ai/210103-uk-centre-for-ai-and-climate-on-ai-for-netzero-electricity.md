title: UK Centre for AI and Climate on AI for net-zero electricity
---

The United Kingdom [Centre for AI & Climate](https://www.icaiec.org/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) organized [a workshop on AI for Net Zero electricity](https://www.icaiec.org/post/a-i-for-net-zero-electricity-workshop-outcomes?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in November 2020.
Outcomes of the workshop include five high-level recommendations: (1) develop a vision and roadmap for the role of AI in reaching a net-zero electricity system; (2) create and distribute energy-AI training resources and build links with universities; (3) invest in explainable AI; (4) coordinate the development of data standards and access to key datasets; and (5) for government agencies to engage more closely with businesses.
These all sound very reasonable to me — much better than most high-level “how will we sprinkle AI into this?” business strategies I’ve read!
It’d be interesting to see if the European Union, the United States, China, India, etc.
also have strategies on this.
