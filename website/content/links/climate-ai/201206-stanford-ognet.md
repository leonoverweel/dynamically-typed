Researchers from Andrew Ng’s Stanford ML Group have “developed and deployed [a deep learning model called OGNet](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/ognet/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to detect oil and gas infrastructure in aerial imagery.” They’ve used it to create an open dataset with 7,000+ images of nearly 150 oil refineries — including several facilities that were not yet included in existing public datasets — which they hope will make it easier to attribute satellite-detected methane emissions to their sources on the ground.
The paper by [Sheng & Irving et al.
(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07227?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) will be published at the 2020 NeurIPS workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning.
Research like this has the potential to become a key tool for climate policy makers and enforcers.
