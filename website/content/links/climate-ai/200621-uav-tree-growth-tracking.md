title: UAV tree growth tracking
---

[Williams et al.
(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06624?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) present a pipeline for tracking “early-successional” species of trees that are the first to appear after an area has been logged, when the forest begins to recover.
They process videos from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and use SVMs and random forests to identify the crowns of different species of trees in Indonesia.
