Facebook AI Research and CMU’s Department of Chemical Engineering have teamed up to launch [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), a collaborative battery technology research effort in “using AI to model and discover new catalysts to address the energy challenges posed by climate change.” Practically, this comes in the form of [a dataset](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/master/DATASET.md?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [open-source baseline models](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and [a leader board](https://opencatalystproject.org/leaderboard.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
