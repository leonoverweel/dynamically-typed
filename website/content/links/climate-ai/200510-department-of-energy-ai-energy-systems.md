title: DoE invests in AI for energy systems
---

The US Department of Energy has announced that it’s [investing $30 million in research on ML/AI research on energy systems](https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-announces-30-million-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Two specific areas of interest are ML for predictive modeling and simulation (presumably stuff like [DeepMind’s wind farm power output predictions](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), see [DT #8](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/8-should-openai-open-source-their-impressive-new-language-model-161119?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) and AI for “decision support” in managing complex systems in general.
