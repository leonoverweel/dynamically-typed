title: Cloud nowcasting progress
---

Some recent progress on nowcasting (predicting over the next few hours) the locations of clouds: [Berthomier et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11577?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) compared the effectiveness of several deep learning models for the task, and Jack Kelly of [Open Climate Fix](https://openclimatefix.org/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) open-sourced [a Python notebook](https://github.com/openclimatefix/predict_pv_yield_2/blob/master/notebooks/optical_flow_1.ipynb?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) that approaches the same problem using optimal flow.
This work is a step towards improving predictions of solar panelsâ€™ power output, an important task for operators as an increasing fraction of the electricity supply on their grids transitions to solar.
