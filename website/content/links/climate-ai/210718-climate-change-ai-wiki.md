There is now a [Climate Change AI Wiki](https://wiki.climatechange.ai/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Climate_Change_AI_Wiki?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
It has sections on climate + machine learning research into mitigation, adaptation, climate science, and tools for action.
Some of my favorite pages so far are the ones on [electricity systems](https://wiki.climatechange.ai/wiki/Electricity_Systems?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [transportation](https://wiki.climatechange.ai/wiki/Transportation?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [forestry and other land use](https://wiki.climatechange.ai/wiki/Forestry_and_Other_Land_Use?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and [weather forecasting](https://wiki.climatechange.ai/wiki/Weather_forecasting?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
A good website to bookmark!
