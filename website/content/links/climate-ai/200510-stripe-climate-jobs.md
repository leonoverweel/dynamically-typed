Job alert: Ryan Orbuch’s team at Stripe [is hiring two fullstack engineers and a product designer](https://twitter.com/orbuch/status/1254848416212869120?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), “to make it easy for users to have a real impact on climate.” Stripe’s execution is always top-tier so if you’re a designer or software engineer looking for a change of employment, this is the most sure-fire way you can help the climate.
