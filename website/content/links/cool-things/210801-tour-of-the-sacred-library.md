CLIP, one of [OpenAI’s recent multimodal neural networks](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2021/openai-dall-e-clip/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), is becoming one of the main models in AI artists’ tool belts.
They’ve discovered that one funny side effect from CLIP being trained on internet data is that, while prompting the model with the text “flowing landscape” causes it to generate a bit of a bland image, prompting it with “flowing landscape | Incredible Realistic 3D Rendered Background” produces amazing results.
Similarly, Ryan Moulton prompted CLIP by describing a scene and suffixing it with “in the sacred library by [James Gurney](https://jamesgurney.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter),” which resulted in a beautifully stylized set of images: [Tour of the Sacred Library](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2021/07/20/tour-of-the-sacred-library/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) — _Come, walk with me for a while through latent space_.
Worth a click.
