[ML x ART](https://mlart.co?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a new 340-piece collection of creative machine learning experiments, curated by [Google Arts & Culture Lab](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/arts-culture?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) resident [Emil Wallner](https://twitter.com/EmilWallner/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
I came across a few projects I’ve featured here on DT, and tons I hadn’t seen before — I definitely recommend spending some time scrolling through it!
