title: Nothing Breaks Like an AI Heart
---

For The Pudding and together with GPT-3, OpenAI engineer Pamela Mishkin wrote [Nothing Breaks Like A.I.
Heart](https://pudding.cool/2021/03/love-and-ai/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), “an essay about artificial intelligence, emotional intelligence, and finding an ending.” It’s a mix of sentences written by Mishkin and ones generated by GPT-3, and it has interactive elements that allow you to click through different completions, to tweak parts of the story to your liking.
At some points, you can even “pivot” it to different branches of where the story could go.
It’s a lovely, very Pudding-like project, that also explains a lot of the limitations of language models along the way — worth a click!
