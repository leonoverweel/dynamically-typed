[Runway](https://runwayml.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), the “app store” of easy-to-use machine learning models accessible through a Photoshop-like interface, has launched a new [Runway Research](https://research.runwayml.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) blog.
It features [technical walkthroughs](https://research.runwayml.com/understanding-video-object-segmentation?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [overviews of their open-source work](https://github.com/runwayml/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and [a deep dive](https://research.runwayml.com/building-a-web-based-real-time-video-editing-tool-with-machine-learning?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) into their [Green Screen video editing tool](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/productized-ai/201122-runwayml-green-screen/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Sadly, though, there’s no RSS feed for the blog yet.
