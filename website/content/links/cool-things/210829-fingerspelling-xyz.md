[Fingerspelling.xyz](https://fingerspelling.xyz?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a web experience that helps you learn to spell in American Sign Language.
It uses an on-device hand tracking model to both visualize the position of your fingers and judge whether you’re making the correct sign, and then walks you through spelling different words.
The site is super well-polished: it’s fast and it even highlights which of your fingers are in the right and wrong places in real time.
Definitely the must-click link from today’s DT.
