title: How normal am I?
---

[How normal am I?](https://www.hownormalami.eu?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a really cool EU-sponsored experiment that runs a bunch of machine learning models on your webcam video feed to determine your perceived beauty, age, gender, BMI, life expectancy, and “face print.” This all happens locally on your laptop (no data is uploaded to a server), and during the whole experiment a video of a friendly researcher talks you through the ways these models are being used by companies and governments in the real world.
It takes about five minutes to run through the whole — quite eye-opening — experience.
(In the end, the project considered me to be about 75% normal: “violently average.”)
