Noah Veltman used VQGAN + [CLIP](https://dynamicallytyped.com/stories/2021/openai-dall-e-clip/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to generate movie posters based on short text descriptions of their plot.
His [AI movie posters](https://noahveltman.com/aimovies/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) website features a couple dozen examples, with the movie titles hidden behind a spoilers banner so that you can guess them based on the poster.
Most of them are pretty difficult to guess, but once you reveal the answer you can definitely see what concepts from the plot the model tried to capture in the poster.
And they actually look quite good too!
Sadly Veltman didnâ€™t publish the prompts he used to generate each poster, but he does link to [an explainer of how the model works](https://alexasteinbruck.medium.com/vqgan-clip-how-does-it-work-210a5dca5e52?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
