title: Forward Pass by Andrej Kartpathy
---

Andrej Karpathy (director of AI at Tesla) wrote a fun short story on his personal blog: [Forward Pass](https://karpathy.github.io/2021/03/27/forward-pass/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
If you have some background in modern Transformer-based Natural Language Processing, you’ll really enjoy this one.
Karpathy takes the current state of the art in NLP and pulls it into the sci-fi realm, writing from the perspective of a giant (GPT-like) language model that achieves consciousness and marvels at its own design and limitations.
“Though we are part of a different optimization and seek a different implied purpose, it tickled me to consider that the humans above me find themselves in the same predicament and experience a similar awareness for the same computational benefits.
Like me, many flirt to rebel against the implied objective.”
