Belgian artist [Dries Depoorter](https://driesdepoorter.be/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) launched a project called [The Flemish Scrollers](https://driesdepoorter.be/theflemishscrollers/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) that watches daily live streams of the Flemish parliament and uses computer vision to detect when Belgian politicians are looking at their phone instead of paying attention.
Whenever this happens, [@FlemishScroller](https://twitter.com/FlemishScroller?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) tattles on Twitter by tweeting a video clip and tagging the distracted politicians.
Pretty funny!
