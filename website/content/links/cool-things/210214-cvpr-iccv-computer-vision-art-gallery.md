Just like the [NeurIPS ML creativity workshop](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/cool-things/201220-neurips-2020-ml-creativity-gallery/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) has a gallery of accepted works at [aiartonline.com](http://www.aiartonline.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), I found that the [CVPR/ICCV computer vision art workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ec3v-cvpr2021/computer-vision-art-gallery?authuser=0&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) also has an equivalent: [computervisionart.com](https://computervisionart.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)!
The winner of the 2019 workshop was Terence Broad, who trained GANs “to have more variation in the colors they produce […] without any data,” and produced an hour-long loop called [(un) stable equilibrium 1:1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=r6MB555mXXM).
The website also has the short list and all other accepted work, which are worth a browse through.
(The [CFP for this year’s workshop](https://twitter.com/elluba/status/1356984409027727360?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is also now live; the decline is March 15th.)
