title: 'Flim.ai: movie frame search'

After I wrote about [same.energy, a visual search engine](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/stories/2021/sameenergy-a-visual-search-engine/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in the last issue of DT, I came across another similar project this week: [Flim](https://beta.flim.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a search engine for famous movie frames, which uses a computer vision model to tag screenshots with the objects featured in them.
A [search for “clock”](https://beta.flim.ai/?ft=clock&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), for example, yields screen caps from Slumdog Millionaire, V for Vendetta, and Peter Pan.
I can imagine this’ll become a very useful tool for cinematographers or film students who are exploring the different creative ways in which certain subjects have been portrayed in the past.
