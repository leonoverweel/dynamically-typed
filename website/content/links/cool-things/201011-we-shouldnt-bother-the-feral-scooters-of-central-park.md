I came across this short story by Janelle Shane when it premiered as a New York Times “Op-Ed From the Future” last year, but forgot to share it at the time.
I rediscovered and reread it this week, and I still think it’s delightful: [We Shouldn’t Bother the Feral Scooters of Central Park](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/future-scooters-central-park.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
