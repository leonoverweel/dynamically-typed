title: Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis
---

In _Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis_ , [Esser et al.
(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) present “the first results on semantically-guided synthesis of megapixel images with transformers” — high-resolution AI-generated pictures!
The samples on [the project’s website](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) are super impressive.
Their model is “a convolutional VQGAN, which learns a codebook of context-rich visual parts, whose composition is modeled with an autoregressive transformer.”
