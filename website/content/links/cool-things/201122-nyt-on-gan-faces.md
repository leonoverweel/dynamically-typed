If you’re going to click one link from today’s DT, make it this one.
The New York Times’ Kashmir Hill and Jeremy White wrote [an amazing new visual article about GAN-generated human faces](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/21/science/artificial-intelligence-fake-people-faces.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
It details how projects like [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (see [DT #8](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/8-should-openai-open-source-their-impressive-new-language-model-161119?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) and Rosebud.AI ([#37](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/37-openai-s-neural-network-taxonomy-decoding-text-from-brain-implants-and-models-that-don-t-exist-236677?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) work, has embedded examples of latent space sliders that generate faces with different properties, and also includes some tips on spotting images with fake faces.
