Also from NeurIPS 2020: the gallery for this yearâ€™s workshop on [Machine Learning for Creativity and Design](https://neurips2020creativity.github.io?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is live!
I really enjoyed looking through all the new work in the online gallery, which is available at [aiartonline.com](http://www.aiartonline.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
