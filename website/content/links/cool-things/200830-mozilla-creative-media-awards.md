Funding alert: Mozilla is launching [a new $245,000 round of its Creative Media Awards](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/supporting-black-artists-who-are-examining-ai/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for Black artists who are exploring the effects of AI on racial justice.
Iâ€™m excited to see the projects that come out of this.
