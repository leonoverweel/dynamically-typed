As part of its [2021 GPU Technology Conference](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), NVIDIA set up an online [AI Art Gallery](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
It features multimedia work from some of my favorite neural generative art creators, including [Helena Sarin](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/artists/helena-sarin/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Sofia Crespo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/artists/sofia-crespo/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Daniel Ambrosi](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/artists/daniel-ambrosi?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and [Refik Anadol](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/artists/refik-anadol?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Each artistâ€™s page has an interactive experience for their art (like a book viewer or 3D object explorer) as well as an explanation of their process.
All worth a click!
