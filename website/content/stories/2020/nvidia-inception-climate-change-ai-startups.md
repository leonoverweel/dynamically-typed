For the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, Isha Salin wrote about [**three startups using deep learning for environmental monitoring**](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/04/22/geospatial-ai-earth-day/?_lrsc=fccaa0ce-9e1e-4a5e-8af1-b4125b2a6d40&ncid=so-twi-lt-799&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), which are all part of NVIDIA’s [Inception program for startups](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/startups/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
Here’s what they do.

[Orbital Insight](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/08/04/droughts-and-deep-learning-measuring-water-where-its-scarce/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) maps deforestation to aid the [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), similar to the work being done by and 20tree.ai ([DT #25](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/25-ai-powered-rainforest-monitoring-google-s-pixel-4-and-openai-s-rubik-s-cube-solving-robot-hand-204685?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) and David Dao’s lab at ETH Zurich ([DT #28](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/28-ocr-for-latex-equations-night-sight-for-astrophotography-and-a-gpt-2-powered-text-adventure-212704?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)):

> The tool can also help companies assess the risk of deforestation in their supply chains.
> Commodities like palm oil have driven widespread deforestation in Southeast Asia, leading several producers to pledge to achieve zero net deforestation in their supply chains this year.

[3vGeomatics](https://3vgeomatics.com/company/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) monitors the thawing of permafrost on the Canadian Arctic in a project for the Canadian Space Agency.
Why it matters:

> As much as 70 percent of permafrost could melt by 2100, releasing massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.
> Climate change-induced permafrost thaw also causes landslides and erosion that threaten communities and critical infrastructure.

[Azevea](https://www.azavea.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is monitoring construction around oil and gas pipelines to detect construction activities that may damage the pipes and cause leaks:

> The U.S.
> oil and gas industry leaks an estimated 13 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere each year — much of which is preventable.
> One of the leading sources is excavation damage caused by third parties, unaware that they’re digging over a natural gas pipeline.

I’m always a bit hesitant to cover ML startups that work with oil and gas companies, but I think in this case their work is a net benefit.
