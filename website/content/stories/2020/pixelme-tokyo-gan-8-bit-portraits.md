_Pixel-me at graduation._

Japanese developer [Sato](https://twitter.com/sato_neet?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) released [pixel-me.tokyo](https://pixel-me.tokyo/en?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), a website that generates an 8-bit style portrait based on user-submitted photos.
It works both on human faces and pets.
Sato also previously made [AI Gahaku](https://ai-art.tokyo/en?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (“AI master painter”), which creates portraits in the style of classical painters.
He built both projects using pix2pix, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that’s commonly used for AI art projects.
Google developer advocate Kaz Sato (“similar names, but we are not the same person”) [wrote up a nice piece for the Google Cloud blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/using-google-cloud-platform-free-tier-to-scale-out-an-ai-service?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) about Sato’s process the projects.
