title: Autonomous trucks will be the first big self-driving market
---

**Autonomous trucking is where I think self-driving vehicle technology will have its first big impact** , much before e.g.
the taxi or ride sharing industries.
Long-distance highway truck driving — with hubs at city borders where human drivers take over — is a much simpler problem to solve than inner-city taxi driving.
Beyond the obvious lower complexity of not having to deal with traffic lights, small streets and pedestrians, a specific highway route between two high-value hubs can also be mapped in high detail much more economically than an ever-changing city center could.
And, of course, self-driving trucks won’t have the 11-hour-per-day driving safety limit imposed on human drivers.
This all makes for quite an attractive pitch when taken together.

In recent news, [Jennifer Smith at the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/robot-trucks-are-seeking-inroads-into-freight-business-11598954400?redirect=amp&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#click=https://t.co/FHbnibCvDc) that startup [Ike Robotics](https://www.ike.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) has reservations for its first 1,000 heavy-duty autonomous trucks, from “transport operators Ryder System Inc., NFI Industries Inc.
and the U.S.
supply-chain arm of German logistics giant Deutsche Post AG.”

> Tapping into big carriers’ logistics networks and operational expertise means Ike can focus on the technology piece—systems engineering, safety and technical challenges such as computer vision—said Chief Executive Alden Woodrow.

> “They are going to help us make sure we build the right product, and we are going to help them prepare to adopt it and be successful,” said Mr.
> Woodrow, who worked on self-driving trucks at Uber Technologies Inc.
> before co-founding Ike in 2018.

Unlike rival startups, Ike wants to be a software-as-a-service provider of self-driving tech for existing logistics operators, instead of becoming one themselves.
It’ll be interesting to see how well this business model works out when competitors start offering a similar service — the biggest question is how easy or hard it’ll be for an operator to swap one self-driving SaaS out for another.
If it’s easy, that’ll make for a very competitive space.

(On the disruption side: there are nearly 3 million truck drivers in the United States alone, so widespread automation here can be quite impactful.
Until today, I thought trucking was the biggest profession in most US states because of [this 2015 NPR article](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state?t=1601202508006&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), but apparently that was [based on wrongly interpreted statistics](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-truck-driver-isnt-the-most-common-job-in-your-state-2015-02-12?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter); the most common job is in retail — no surprise there.
Nonetheless, trucking is currently a major profession.
A decade from now it may no longer be.)
