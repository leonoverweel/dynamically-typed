_The Discover app of the AI Incident Database_

The [Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society](https://www.partnershiponai.org/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (PAI) is an international coalition of organizations with the mision “to shape best practices, research, and public dialogue about AI’s benefits for people and society.” Its [100+ member organizations](https://www.partnershiponai.org/partners/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) cover a broad range of interests and include leading AI research labs (DeepMind, OpenAI); several universities (MIT, Cornell); most big tech companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft); news media (NYT, BBC); and humanitarian organizations (Unicef, ACLU).

**PAI recently launched a new project: the**[ **AI Incident Database**](https://incidentdatabase.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) **.**
The AIID mimics [the FAA’s airplane accidents database](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/accident_incident/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and is similarly meant to help “future researchers and developers avoid repeated bad outcomes.” It’s launching with a set of [93 incidents](https://incidentdatabase.ai/summaries/incidents?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), including an autonomous car that [killed a pedestrian](https://incidentdatabase.ai/discover/index.html?incident_id=4&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), a trading algorithm that [caused a flash crash](https://incidentdatabase.ai/discover/index.html?incident_id=28&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and a facial recognition system that [caused an innocent person to be arrested](https://incidentdatabase.ai/discover/index.html?incident_id=74&s=&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (see [DT #43](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/productized-ai/200705-facial-recognition-false-arrest/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
For each incident, the database includes a set of news articles that reported about it: there are over 1,000 reports in the AIID so far.
It’s also open source on GitHub, at [PartnershipOnAI/aiid](https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/aiid?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Systems like this (and [Amsterdam’s AI registry](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/productized-ai/201011-amsterdam-ai-algorithm-registry/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), for example) are a clear sign that productized AI is a quickly starting to mature as a field, and that lots of good work is being done to manage its impact.
Most importantly, I hope these projects will help us have more sensible discussions about regulating AI.
Benedict Evans’ essays [Notes on AI Bias](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/4/15/notes-on-ai-bias?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Face recognition and AI ethics](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/9/6/face-recognition?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) are excellent reads on this; he compares calls to “regulate AI” to wanting to regulate databases — it’s not the right level of abstraction, and we should be thinking about specific policies to address specific problems instead.
A dataset of categorized AI incidents, managed by a broad coalition of organizations, sounds like a great step in this direction.
