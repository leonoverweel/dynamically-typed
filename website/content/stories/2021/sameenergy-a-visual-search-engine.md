_Same.Energy visual search_

[same.energy](https://same.energy?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a deep learning-powered visual search engine built by [Jason Jackson](https://jacobjackson.com/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (the creator of [TabNine](https://jacobjackson.com/first-month/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), see [DT #18](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/issues/018/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), who says it works similarly to [OpenAI’s CLIP](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/stories/2021/openai-dall-e-clip/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
It’s a really nice website to just browse around for a while and get lost in, which is also exactly what it’s meant for.
Jackson, on the site’s [about page](https://same.energy/about?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), says:

> We believe that image search should be visual, using only a minimum of words.
> And we believe it should integrate a rich visual understanding, capturing the artistic style and overall mood of an image, not just the objects in it.
> We hope Same Energy will help you discover new styles, and perhaps use them as inspiration.“

This may remind you of Google’s similar image search, but I found that same.energy does a much better job of finding diverse results: where Google will usually show me different crops and resolutions of the same photo or different photos of the same object, same.energy manages to capture the "feel” of an image and show more (different!) images with that same “feel.” Some of my favorite searches so far are __[blue geometric patterns](https://same.energy/search?i=DiiK&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [glass art](https://same.energy/search?i=xHbEn&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and [rusty surfaces](https://same.energy/search?i=2T5ED&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
