Hey there, welcome to Dynamically Typed #56.
First, a personal update going into the new year: **I‚Äôm starting a new job!**
Monday will be my first day as machine learning engineer at [Dexter Energy](https://dexterenergy.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), an Amsterdam-based startup that uses AI to predict and optimize renewable (mostly wind/solar) power sources.

The world is deploying [ever-cheaper renewables](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) at a breakneck pace, and in the next decades we‚Äôll need to do this even more, even faster, [to cleanly energize the world](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
As electricity on the grid is increasingly supplied by highly variable wind and solar sources, forecasting and optimizing them becomes increasingly important.
How much sun will there be in two hours?
Should I sell my wind park‚Äôs power directly to the grid, or charge a battery now and sell it later?
This is where AI comes in: see [DeepMind‚Äôs wind forecasting project](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), for example, and lots of work at the [2019](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/30-climate-change-ai-at-neurips-2019-special-edition-217578?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [2020](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2020?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) Climate Change AI workshops.
The seminal [97-page CCAI paper](https://climatechange.ai/paper?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#page=7&zoom=auto,0,725) also calls out power forecasting as a High Leverage application of AI to climate (see [DT #16](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/16-finding-whales-with-ai-and-97-pages-of-ml-for-climate-change-183400?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).
I‚Äôve been [writing about this stuff](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/climate-ai/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in Dynamically Typed for almost two years now, so I‚Äôm super excited that I‚Äôll finally get to apply my own ML and software engineering skills to these problems directly!

Anyway, back to today‚Äôs DT: there hasn‚Äôt been too much action in the AI world over the past two (holiday) weeks, but I still found a few cool links across most categories, including several from NeurIPS 2020 (the biggest AI conference, which ran from December 6th to 12th).

## Productized Artificial Intelligence üîå

* üöó Business Insider‚Äôs Mathias D√∂pfner did a long new [interview with Elon Musk](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-interview-axel-springer-tesla-accelerate-advent-of-sustainable-energy?IR=T&international=true&r=US&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). It covers a lot, and most of it isn‚Äôt too relevant to DT, but this Musk quote is: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely confident that Tesla will have level five [self driving] next year, extremely confident, 100%.‚Äù Yes, this definitely isn‚Äôt the first time Musk has claimed full self driving is just around the corner, but my slightly contrarian take ([from a few months ago](https://twitter.com/layon_overwhale/status/1294402087799992321?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) is that I actually _do_ think Tesla will get to a useful level of self-driving ‚Äî deployed at scale in consumer cars ‚Äî first. Their big bet years ago that vision (without LIDAR) is enough for autonomy has enabled them to be years ahead of the competition with their dataset. They‚Äôve harnessed their fleet of Telsas on real roads for very clever sampling, feedback loops (ghost mode), and regression testing; Andrej Karpath, (Tesla‚Äôs head of AI, had [a really great talk on all this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&t=515&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=hx7BXih7zx8) in April last year.

## Machine Learning Research üéõ

_The evolution of DeepMind's reinforcement learning algorithms. (DeepMind)_

* üëæ New from DeepMind, in Nature: _Mastering Atari, Go, chess and shogi by planning with a learned model_ by [Schrittwieser et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03051-4?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). The paper describes DeepMind‚Äôs new games-playing reinforcement learning algorithm [MuZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), which is the latest evolution of the lab‚Äôs previous [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2016), [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphago-zero-starting-scratch?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2017), and [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (2018) algorithms. The key improvement in MuZero is that it doesn‚Äôt need to be explicitly told the rules of the games it plays: it‚Äôs model-free, and ‚Äújust models aspects that are important to the agent‚Äôs decision-making process.‚Äù This helps it achieve state-of-the-art (and superhuman) results on the Atari suite, Go, chess, and shogi.
* üß† Fran√ßois Chollet‚Äôs NeurIPS [talk on abstraction and reasoning](https://slideslive.com/38935790/abstraction-reasoning-in-ai-systems-modern-perspectives?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), based on his 2019 [Measure of Intelligence paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (see [DT #26](https://dynamicallytyped.com/issues/26-chollet-s-measure-of-intelligence-and-bert-in-google-search-207148?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)), is a great watch. It covers the shortcut rule (‚Äúyou get what you optimize for ‚Äî at the detriment of everything else‚Äù); levels of generalization; and what kinds of abstraction he thinks deep learning can and cannot solve (by itself). The tutorial also included [a talk on analogical reasoning](https://slideslive.com/38935791/abstraction-reasoning-in-ai-systems-modern-perspectives?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) by Melanie Mitchell and [one on math reasoning](https://slideslive.com/38935792/deep-learning-for-mathematical-reasoning?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) by Christian Szegedy; [this live-tweeted thread](https://twitter.com/tetraduzione/status/1336078387572482048?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) by Antonio Vergari summarizes all three talks in bite-size chunks. (RE: the previous link, it‚Äôd be super cool to see DeepMind try to tackle the ARC challenge ‚Äî maybe someday.)

_I‚Äôve also collected all 75+ ML research tools previously featured in Dynamically Typed_[ _on a Notion page_](https://www.notion.so/adab36fecaea4306880898f41dcb9cb3?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=cb3a74562c914234ac171931dad6c2e4) _for quick reference.

## Artificial Intelligence for the Climate Crisis üåç

* üè≠ _Towards Tracking the Emissions of Every Power Plant on the Planet_ by [Couture et al. (2020)](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2020/11/paper.pdf?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) won the Best Pathway to Impact award at the [NeurIPS 2020 CCAI workshop](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2020?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). Supported by [Al Gore‚Äôs Climate TRACE](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/stories/2020/al-gore-launches-climate-trace/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) (and grants from Google.org and Bloomberg Philanthropies), the project ‚Äú[uses] machine learning to infer power generation and emissions from visible and thermal power plant signatures in satellite images.‚Äù In this initial paper, the authors present models that can predict whether a power plant is currently on or off from a single satellite image; their best model, a convolutional neural network, gets a mean average precision of 81% on this binary classification task. Interestingly, they find that the ‚Äúvapor plume‚Äù (steam) from a power plant‚Äôs cooling system is a better indicator for its emissions than the ‚Äúsmoke plume‚Äù (greenhouse gasses) coming out of its main chimney.
* üîå The United Kingdom [Centre for AI & Climate](https://www.icaiec.org/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) organized [a workshop on AI for Net Zero electricity](https://www.icaiec.org/post/a-i-for-net-zero-electricity-workshop-outcomes?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in November 2020. Outcomes of the workshop include five high-level recommendations: (1) develop a vision and roadmap for the role of AI in reaching a net-zero electricity system; (2) create and distribute energy-AI training resources and build links with universities; (3) invest in explainable AI; (4) coordinate the development of data standards and access to key datasets; and (5) for government agencies to engage more closely with businesses. These all sound very reasonable to me ‚Äî much better than most high-level ‚Äúhow will we sprinkle AI into this?‚Äù business strategies I‚Äôve read! It‚Äôd be interesting to see if the European Union, the United States, China, India, etc. also have strategies on this.

_Sample images from Taming Transformers, with resolutions 1280x832, 1024x416, and 1280x240, from top to bottom. (Esser et al., 2020)_

* üñº In _Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis_ , [Esser et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) present ‚Äúthe first results on semantically-guided synthesis of megapixel images with transformers‚Äù ‚Äî high-resolution AI-generated pictures! The samples on [the project‚Äôs website](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) are super impressive. Their model is ‚Äúa convolutional VQGAN, which learns a codebook of context-rich visual parts, whose composition is modeled with an autoregressive transformer.‚Äù
