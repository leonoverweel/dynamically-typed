Hey everyone, welcome to Dynamically Typed #60.
Two weeks after we were [ice skating on the canals](https://twitter.com/schlijper/status/1361780404081078277?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), spring has arrived in Amsterdam and I‚Äôm sitting on the roof, writing this issue in the sun after a great row this morning!
üåûüö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

For productized AI, I wrote about the car crash detection feature on Google‚Äôs Pixel phones, and about an NYT article on Exposing.AI, a tool that traces facial recognition datasets back to their Flickr origins.
For ML research, I‚Äôve got a cool new open-source AutoML tool from Google called Model Search, plus three new long reads from Distill.
Finally, for cool things, I found an ML-powered website that lets you find movie screenshots based on the objects in them.

## Productized Artificial Intelligence üîå

* üöò Apparently, [Google‚Äôs Pixel phones can detect car crashes](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7055029?hl=en&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). This was making the rounds on Twitter after a Reddit user wrote on r/GooglePixel that [car crash detection saved them from hours of suffering](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/lq3k0a/car_crash_detection_saved_me_hours_of_suffering/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) because they had an accident on their own property, where no one would otherwise have found them for a long time. When the phone detects a crash, it calls local emergency services [and says](https://i.imgur.com/ChikTEx.jpg?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), ‚ÄúYou are being contacted by an automated emergency voice service on behalf of a caller. The caller‚Äôs phone detected a possible car crash, and they were unresponsive. Please send help,‚Äù followed by the phone‚Äôs latest location. Pretty amazing stuff, that‚Äôs being built into more and more products ‚Äî Apple Watches have a similar [fall detection feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=jvmqqh1xIs4). Dave Burke, Google‚Äôs VP of engineering for Android, noticed the story and [tweeted a photo of the setup they used to train the ML model powering this feature](https://twitter.com/davey_burke/status/1364276591778390016?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). Worth a click.
* üëÅ Cade Metz and Kashmir Hill at The New York Times wrote about how [old Flickr photos became a part of facial recognition datasets](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/technology/facial-recognition-photo-tool.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). The story centers around [Exposing.AI](https://exposing.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), a tool that can show you whether your face is a featured in any popular facial recognition datasets like VGG Face, MegaFace and FaceScrub, based on your Flickr username or a photo URL. Beyond that, it‚Äôs a good read that goes into how, five to ten years ago when AI was not yet very influential, commercial and university labs were building lots of different facial recognition datasets and, in the spirit of open science, sharing them publicly on the internet. Only now that it‚Äôs becoming clear that [facial recognition systems are biased](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/productized-ai/200927-facial-recognition-remains-biased/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ‚Äî as I covered last summer in [Is it enough for only big tech to pull out of facial recognition?](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/stories/2020/big-tech-exits-facial-recognition/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Facial recognition false arrest](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/productized-ai/200705-facial-recognition-false-arrest/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ‚Äî some of these datasets are being taken offline. But these systems exist now, and taking down the datasets won‚Äôt stop them from being used; [only regulation will](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/links/productized-ai/200802-us-facial-recognition-legislation/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

## Machine Learning Research üéõ

* ‚ö°Ô∏è Google [has released Model Search](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/02/introducing-model-search-open-source.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), an open-source AutoML platform for the TensorFlow ecosystem. The pitch: ‚ÄúModel Search is domain agnostic, flexible and is capable of finding the appropriate architecture that best fits a given dataset and problem, while minimizing coding time, effort and compute resources.‚Äù It can run on a single machine or in a distributed setting, and uses a reinforcement learning-inspired ‚Äúexplore & exploit‚Äù methodology to find a model architecture that optimizes for user-specified metrics. For efficiency, Model Search also uses knowledge distillation and weight sharing between experiments runs. It‚Äôs available on GitHub at [google/model_search](https://github.com/google/model_search?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
* üìú Three new long reads on Distill: a bit of a meta article about how they think about [Visualizing Weights](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/visualizing-weights/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), which has been an important feature in lots of the publication‚Äôs recent articles; a new entry to the [Circuits thread](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) on reverse-engineering [Curve Circuits](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/curve-circuits/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter); and an application of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) for generating [Self-Organizing Textures](https://distill.pub/selforg/2021/textures/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). That last one features a fun interactive graphic at the top. I didn‚Äôt get around to reading these in detail before sending out today‚Äôs DT ‚Äî they‚Äôre quite long ‚Äî but wanted to share them anyways.

## Cool Things ‚ú®

![Searching for "clock" on Film.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/007/906/998/mail/Screenshot_2021-02-28_at_13.32.35.png?1614515620)

_Searching for "clock" on Film._

* üéû After I wrote about [same.energy, a visual search engine](https://dynamically-typed.netlify.app/stories/2021/sameenergy-a-visual-search-engine/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in the last issue of DT, I came across another similar project this week: [Flim](https://beta.flim.ai?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a search engine for famous movie frames, which uses a computer vision model to tag screenshots with the objects featured in them. A [search for ‚Äúclock‚Äù](https://beta.flim.ai/?ft=clock&utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), for example, yields screen caps from Slumdog Millionaire, V for Vendetta, and Peter Pan. I can imagine this‚Äôll become a very useful tool for cinematographers or film students who are exploring the different creative ways in which certain subjects have been portrayed in the past.
