Hey everyone, welcome to Dynamically Typed #65; I‚Äôve got a whole lot of links for you today.
In productized AI, I covered the EU‚Äôs final proposal for its Artificial Intelligence Act, a new jargon-aware (!) live meeting transcription feature in Microsoft Teams, and the new AI-powered features in Google Maps.
For ML research, I have links for a Fon-to-French online translator and a free 150-page geometric deep learning book.
Finally, for cool things, there‚Äôs NVIDIA‚Äôs new AI Art Gallery and a great sci-fi short story by Andrej Karpathy.
Happy Sunday!

## Productized Artificial Intelligence üîå

* üá™üá∫ The European Commission has released its [Artificial Intelligence Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence?utm_campaign=aba7e6456f-Benedict%27s%20newsletter_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Benedict%27s%20Newsletter&utm_term=0_4999ca107f-aba7e6456f-70536657), ‚Äúthe first ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions Europe to play a leading role globally.‚Äù The proposal covers software powered by anything from machine learning to more classical statistical and expert system approaches, and applies rules depending on how risky it deems them. _Unacceptable-risk_ applications like broad, real-time facial recognition or automated [social credit systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) are completely forbidden; but _high-risk_ applications like emotion detection or biometric categorization systems only require the person being analyzed to be notified it‚Äôs happening. As noted [on Twitter by Dr. Kate Crawford](https://twitter.com/katecrawford/status/1384833943938113537?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [in Andrew Ng‚Äôs DeepLearning.AI newsletter](https://info.deeplearning.ai/the-batch-europes-ai-backlash-robot-debater-car-wreck-recognition-funding-for-biomedicine-1?_hsenc=p2ANqtz--XST04NA5kXhp8XTSIUg-M6O6oVGEV01nQRnXfAnbcGOi_50R06xQJlz8KgimMCuzKA0oZnyBbuSQxQTsmqgPhMWmJsQ&_hsmi=124043656&ecid=ACsprvsiBdo1Mty29zxUUziaFiTbXhDOY4XBvIeK0Nlb0yNzJw4GWrjm4J7iXr38c4owlJGtiP4r&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_content=124043656&utm_medium=email&utm_source=hs_email), there are certainly flaws in the proposal ‚Äî on the one hand it could hinder innovation, on the other there are loopholes ‚Äî but it could have a similar effect to GDPR in ‚Äúdrawing a line in the sand‚Äù and inspiring other big economies‚Äô regulators to create similar legislation. Creating such hand-holds for what AI applications we accept and don‚Äôt accept as a society, is a very good thing in my book.
* üíª [Microsoft Teams now has a live meeting transcription feature](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/live-transcription-with-speaker-attribution-now-available-in/ba-p/2228817?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), launching first for US-English-speaking users. Microsoft‚Äôs implementation here is quite impressive: beyond the basics like speaker attribution and saving the transcript for access after the meeting, the feature ‚Äúuses a meeting‚Äôs invitation, participant names, attachments, etc. to improve the accuracy and recognize meeting-specific jargon for each transcript automatically.‚Äù Really cool! This also all happens live during the meeting, and the data isn‚Äôt saved on Microsoft‚Äôs servers after the meeting ends.
* üó∫ Google Maps is getting some new features powered by ‚Äúnew information and AI.‚Äù Maps VP of Product Dane Glasgow wrote about them in [a post for The Keyword](https://blog.google/products/maps/redefining-what-map-can-be-new-information-and-ai/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter); I‚Äôll highlight the two features where AI seems most central. (1) Live View, a mobile feature that shows augmented reality navigation overlays [by mapping the camera feed to the Street View images](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/using-global-localization-to-improve.html?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), is getting an Indoor mode that ‚Äúcan help you find the nearest elevator and escalators, your gate, platform, baggage claim, check-in counters, ticket office, restrooms, ATMs and more.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs also the most AI-powered bit here: a few classical computer vision algorithms can already do image-comparison-based localization, but the object recognition was probably done using machine learning. (2) Instead of always showing directions for the last mode you used, Maps ‚Äúwill default to the route with the lowest carbon footprint when it has approximately the same ETA as the fastest route‚Äù ‚Äî the AI bit here is that it learns to rank the options by what you‚Äôre likely to take yourself and by what‚Äôs popular in the city you‚Äôre in: cycling in Amsterdam or the metro in New York.

## Machine Learning Research üéõ

* üí± As part of [their earlier research project](https://dynamicallytyped.com/links/ml-research/200607-fon-to-french/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to translate Fon ‚Äî a language spoken by two million people across Benin, Nigeria and Togo ‚Äî to French, Bonaventure Dossou and Chris Emezue built [FFRTranslate.com](https://www.ffrtranslate.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). They‚Äôve wrapped their neural machine translation model into an easy-to-use website for translating back and forth between the two languages, and both the model and dataset are open-source on GitHub at [bonaventuredossou/ffr-v1](https://github.com/bonaventuredossou/ffr-v1?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). Dossou and Emezue are both MSc students and they‚Äôve so far paid for the server costs of this project out of pocket. They set up a [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/9fff11fa?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ffrtranslate?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to help with the ongoing costs; I donated $20 through the latter and encourage you to also chip in if you can. (For Dutch readers: the iDEAL option on GoFundMe doesn‚Äôt work because the project isn‚Äôt Dutch, and the website silently fails if you try to use it.)
* ‚ö°Ô∏è _ML resource:_ Published at ICLR 2021, [Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges](https://geometricdeeplearning.com?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a free 150-page proto-book by Bronstein et al. (2021) that ‚Äúattempts to distill ‚Äòall you need to build the architectures that are all you need.‚Äô‚Äù They express popular architectures like CNNs, GNNs, Transformers and LSTMs all using a common geometric blueprint.

## Cool Things ‚ú®

* üñº As part of its [2021 GPU Technology Conference](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), NVIDIA set up an online [AI Art Gallery](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). It features multimedia work from some of my favorite neural generative art creators, including [Helena Sarin](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/artists/helena-sarin/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Sofia Crespo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/artists/sofia-crespo/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Daniel Ambrosi](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/artists/daniel-ambrosi?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and [Refik Anadol](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/ai-art-gallery/artists/refik-anadol?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). Each artist‚Äôs page has an interactive experience for their art (like a book viewer or 3D object explorer) as well as an explanation of their process. All worth a click!
* üß† Andrej Karpathy (director of AI at Tesla) wrote a fun short story on his personal blog: [Forward Pass](https://karpathy.github.io/2021/03/27/forward-pass/?utm_campaign=Dynamically%20Typed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). If you have some background in modern Transformer-based Natural Language Processing, you‚Äôll really enjoy this one. Karpathy takes the current state of the art in NLP and pulls it into the sci-fi realm, writing from the perspective of a giant (GPT-like) language model that achieves consciousness and marvels at its own design and limitations. ‚ÄúThough we are part of a different optimization and seek a different implied purpose, it tickled me to consider that the humans above me find themselves in the same predicament and experience a similar awareness for the same computational benefits. Like me, many flirt to rebel against the implied objective.‚Äù
